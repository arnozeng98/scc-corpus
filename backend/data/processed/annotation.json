        "Facts": " 2.The aim of the R.I.D.E. program in Ontario is to reduce impaired driving by detecting the impaired motorist and deterring others from driving after drinking. The police go to a location where they believe there has been a high incidence of impaired driving or alcohol related accidents. Motorists passing through this location are requested, on a random basis, to pull over and stop. Police officers ask the driver for a valid driver's licence and proof of insurance and they note the condition of the vehicle and the driver. The demand for a licence and proof of insurance is made for the purpose of initiating conversation with the ultimate goal of allowing the police to detect the drinking driver whom they might otherwise be unable to detect. R.I.D.E. officers are equipped with approved road‑side screening devices to permit them to make demands for breath samples, pursuant to s. 234.1 of theCriminal Code, if they form the requisite grounds during their conversation with the driver.  3.The appellant was signalled to stop by a police officer participating in the R.I.D.E. program on February 4, 1980. The only reason he was requested by the police to stop was the R.I.D.E. program. There was nothing improper about his driving or the condition of his car. The police did not have reasonable and probable grounds for believing he had committed or was committing a criminal offence under any statute, either provincial or federal. The officer did not, at the time of the stop, have any reasonable suspicion that the appellant had alcohol in his body.  4.The appellant complied with the request to stop his vehicle. During conversation, the police officer formed a reasonable suspicion that the appellant was driving with alcohol in his body and demanded that he provide a sample of his breath. The appellant, following instruction and despite repeated attempts, failed to furnish a sample of his breath sufficient to give a proper reading on the A.L.E.R.T. (Alcohol Level Evaluation Roadside Tester) device. An appearance notice was issued on a charge of failing or refusing to comply with a road‑side demand contrary to s. 234.1(2) of theCriminal Codeand the appellant departed.  5.The appellant was acquitted at trial before Provincial Court Judge Charles: (1980),  55 C.C.C. (2d) 97 at 98, 118 D.L.R. (3d) 425 at 427, 30 O.R. (2d) 555 at 557, 15 C.R. (3d) 261, 6 M.V.R. 233. An appeal by stated case was dismissed by Maloney J. of the Ontario Supreme Court: (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 97, 118 D.L.R. (3d) 425, 30 O.R. (2d) 555, 23 C.R. (3d) 203, 8 M.V.R. 142. A Crown appeal to a five‑member panel of the Ontario Court of Appeal was unanimously allowed: (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 97, 122 D.L.R. (3d) 655, 32 O.R. (2d) 641, 23 C.R. (3d) 228, 10 M.V.R. 59. The Court ordered that the case be remitted to the trial judge for consideration of the question whether the appellant's seeming attempts to comply with the demand were genuine or feigned.  6.The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

        "Facts": " 2.Paul Landry was charged with assaulting a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty, contrary tos. 246(1)of theCriminal Code. The following summary of the facts is based on the testimony of the witnesses. No findings of fact were made at trial as the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal.  3.On the evening of April 20, 1980 a public transit inspector observed two youths opening the driver's side of a parked truck and then trying to open car doors in a parking lot at the back of a shopping centre. He called the police on his radio. When the police arrived he gave them descriptions of the youths and advised them that he had seen the youths enter an apartment building. One of the police officers, Constable Handy, went to the front of the apartment building.  4.Constable Handy testified that as he approached the front door of the apartment building, he looked through the window of the basement apartment and saw two male persons who matched the description given to him by the transit inspector. He entered the building and walked down the stairs to the basement apartment. According to his testimony, the door to the apartment was open. The testimony of Landry and MacLaren (the second youth) differs from that of Constable Handy on this point. Landry testified that the door was closed and the officer knocked on it. Similarly, MacLaren testified that the officer knocked on the door and the door was answered by Landry. It is clear from the testimony of all three parties that Constable Handy stood in the doorway of the apartment and asked Landry if he lived there. Constable Handy testified that Landry replied in an offensive manner.  5.Constable Handy was in uniform at the time. He testified that he told the two youths they were under arrest for investigation of attempted auto theft. MacLaren testified that, initially, Constable Handy said only \"you are under arrest\" and did not state why until asked by MacLaren. Landry then indicated he did not want to go to the police station and both youths stated they had not done anything. Constable Handy walked into the room and stood quite close to them. When MacLaren took some steps toward the open door, Constable Handy took physical control of him by holding the sleeve of his jacket. Landry repeated several times that he was not going anywhere, so Constable Handy grabbed him with the other hand. An altercation ensued which gave rise to the present charge.  II ",

            "1.                What is the proper interpretation of the word \"undue\" in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code ?",
            "13.              In 1959 Parliament amended the provisions of s. 150 (now s. 159) of the Criminal Code  dealing with obscenity by adding subs. (8) (1959 (Can.), c. 41, s. 11) which reads:",
            "23.              Nevertheless, as will presently appear, it is important to remember that from the very beginning of this Court's consideration of s. 159(8) \"community standards\" have been viewed as one measure of \"undueness\" in the exploitation of sex. They have never been seen as the only measure of such undueness; still less has a breach of community standards been treated as in itself a criminal offence.",
            "The Court was urged to define \"community standards\" as community standards of acceptance, i.e., tolerance. I would accept this definition. In the Brodie case Judson J., referred, p. 181, to \"standards of acceptance prevailing in the community\". In the Great West News case, we referred to contemporary standards of tolerance. I have no doubt, as Dr. Rich testified, and as the Judge agreed, a distinction can be made between private taste and standard of tolerance. It can hardly be questioned that many people would find personally offensive, material which they would permit others to read. Parliament, through its legislation on obscenity, could hardly have wished to proscribe as criminal that which was acceptable or tolerable according to current standards of the Canadian community.",
            "42.              The appellant's second ground is that the judge failed to have regard to the unrebutted evidence of the Chairman of the Censor Board that the film did not fall below contemporary community standards. Counsel for the appellant does not contend that censor board approval is a bar to a criminal prosecution. He readily concedes that it is for the courts to decide whether a publication is obscene (Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen (supra); R. v. McFall (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.)",
            "47.              To hold expert evidence admissible with regard to the factual underpinnings of the community standard test for \"undueness\" is, of course, not the same as holding such evidence to be mandatory. In R. v. Great West News Ltd. (supra), the appellants attempted to impose precisely that obligation on the Crown. It was argued that the Crown must fail because no evidence had been put before the court from which the court could objectively determine prevailing community standards. Counsel submitted that the court must determine from evidence placed before it by the Crown: (i) what is the community standard, that is to say, what is the standard of tolerance of Canadians as a whole to material of the nature of that impugned? (ii) does the material impugned so far transcend that standard as to be branded as criminal? After a review of the cases, and speaking also for Smith C.J.M., I had occasion to say, at pp. 314‑15:",
            "64.              McIntyre J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment prepared for delivery by the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. I am in agreement with the Chief Justice that the standard we seek is that of tolerance and that: \"What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it.\" I agree, however, with Madame Justice Wilson that the audience to which a film or other publication is exposed is not relevant to a consideration of whether it is obscene, and also share her view that to formulate the community standard, which is an element of the proof required from the Crown in a criminal case, some evidence, expert or otherwise, must be adduced by the Crown before the trier of fact. I would dispose of the appeal as do the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson.",
            "65.              Wilson J.‑‑I concur in the result reached by the Chief Justice. I wish, however, to express my own view as to what the trial judge did in this case that constituted error in law. In so doing I have found it necessary to some extent to revert to first principles. I start with the wording of s. 159(8) of the Criminal Code which reads:",
            "69.              I think we have to approach the question more directly and ask: do Canadians today accept this degree of exploitation of sex in their movies? If they do, then the movie is not obscene. If they don't, then the exploitation is \"undue\" and, if it is a dominant characteristic of the movie, the movie is deemed to be obscene under the section. It is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but not if shown to another. I do not doubt that it is desirable to regulate the movies that can be shown to different constituencies. A movie which is not obscene within the meaning of the Criminal Code  may still not be desirable viewing material for persons under the age of 18. Such regulation, as will be mentioned later in these reasons, is authorized in various provincial jurisdictions but it is the regulation of material which is not obscene under the Code. I do not think the Court should, by segregating the community into different groups for purposes of ascertaining the standard of tolerance the community would adopt for each group, inject into s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  a series of different tests of obscenity. In my view, a movie is either obscene under the Code based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not. If it is not, it may still be the subject of provincial regulatory control.",
            "71.              Coming back then to the determination of the community standard in the terms I have described, namely the standard the community at any given time is prepared to accept or tolerate, how is this moral consensus to be ascertained? I describe it as a \"moral\" consensus because I agree with the Chief Justice that we are not concerned here with matters of \"taste\". To use the standard accepted by members of the community for themselves does not, in my view, substitute \"taste\" for moral acceptability. I think it is incorrect to say that when I am deciding whether or not I myself am prepared to be shown a certain type of movie I am making a decision merely on the basis of taste but when I am deciding whether or not I am prepared to have that same movie shown to others I am making a decision on the basis of tolerance. This, in my view, is a false distinction. In either case tolerance in the sense of moral acceptability is the issue‑‑in the former case moral acceptability to myself and in the latter moral acceptability to others. People may, of course, refuse to patronize certain movies on grounds of taste but this is not at all what we are concerned with under the Criminal Code .",
            "74.              How is the Court to determine where the line is drawn? By guidelines read into the definition as a matter of interpretation of the word \"undue\"? By consideration of the presumed social ills sought to be avoided by restrictions on freedom of publication? By statistics showing what people are prepared to look at and what they are not? The courts have said that the test is an objective one and clearly that must be so. But objectivity requires criteria and the courts have not been too successful in evolving them. Yet this is a criminal offence and it is basic to our system of criminal justice that the public know what conduct is criminal and what is not.",
            "75.              This, it seems to me, militates very strongly against a community standard test of undueness which varies with \"the targetted group\". I believe it is important to the publishing industry to have some degree of certainty as to when they may be exposing themselves to a criminal charge. The only way to provide that degree of certainty is, in my opinion, to have a uniform community standard test of \"undueness\" under the Code. With great respect to those who think otherwise, I see nothing in s. 159(8) which would permit something to be obscene under the section when shown to X but not obscene when shown to Y. Moreover, it seems to me that this approach would inevitably lead to problems where a publication targetted to one group by the accused fell into the hands of others.",
            "This being a criminal statute we must try to find the vicious purpose aimed at in order to bring parties within its prohibitions.",
            "79.              The community standard test in Canada, I believe, had its origin in Brodie (supra), the Lady Chatterley’s Lover case, in which four members of this Court concluded that the definition of obscenity introduced into the Code in 1957 made the test in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, obsolete. In their view it was no longer necessary to show a tendency to corrupt and deprave if the dominant characteristic of the publication was an exploitation of sex which was \"undue\". The test of \"undueness\", said Mr. Justice Fauteux at p. 697, was whether the exploitation was shocking and disgusting \"having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community....\" Mr. Justice Judson agreed at pp. 705‑06 that the standards of acceptance prevailing in the community provided the test of \"undueness\" for purposes of the definition. The statutory definition, he felt, could not be superimposed upon the Hicklin test without leaving the citizen in the position of not knowing whether he was committing a criminal act or not.",
            "Community standards must be contemporary. Times change, and ideas change with them. Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live. One manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of sex is discussed. In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as indecent and intolerable. We cannot and should not ignore these present‑day attitudes when we face the question whether Dude and Escapade are obscene according to our criminal law.",
            "Community standards must also be local. In other words, they must be Canadian. In applying the definition in the Criminal Code  we must determine what is obscene by Canadian standards, regardless of attitudes which may prevail elsewhere, be they more liberal or less so.",
            "84.              Laskin J.A. was, of course, speaking of expert evidence in the context of that case but it seems to me that the point is well made with respect to non‑expert evidence as well. Having regard to the fact that the onus is on the Crown to establish obscenity beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems to me that the onus is on it to establish both what the community standard of acceptability is and that the accused has gone beyond it. The accused may counter the Crown's evidence of the community standard with evidence of its own and the judge may reach his decision on the evidence in the usual way. In my view it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned conduct is to be measured. As Borins Co. Ct. J. said in R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (supra) the legislature cannot credibly expect a trier of fact to have his finger on the \"pornographic pulse of the nation\". Moreover, it is wrong in principle. It leaves the accused with no way of knowing the case it has to meet, at what level of acceptability the line will be drawn by any particular judge. There is no certainty. It is the length of the Chancellor's foot imported into the criminal law.",
            "89.              In my view, the practice of allowing the trier of fact to rely exclusively on his or her personal experience of community standards of tolerance (see R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970] 4 C.C.C. 307 (Man. C.A.) at pp. 314‑15) is an invitation to the type of error committed by the trial judge in this case. The problem can be readily avoided by requiring the Crown to adduce evidence of the community standard. The trier of fact would then determine the community standard on the basis of the evidence before him in the same way as he determines the factual issues in any other kind of criminal case."

        "Facts": " 2.In January, 1980, the accused company was owner and manager of a theatre, known as Jasper Cinema (Blue), located in the City of Edmonton. The cinema was a typical picture theatre showing motion picture films to members of the public who paid an admission fee. On January 25 to 27, 1980 the accused was regularly presenting showings of a motion picture calledDracula Sucks. The film had been given a \"Restricted\" rating by the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. A copy of the motion picture was seized by the Edmonton City Police on January 27, 1980, after the public showing on that date and before the scheduled second public showing. The accused was charged and tried before a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. Three witnesses testified.  3.Staff Sergeant Ashworth of the Edmonton City Police said he had attended and observed the film and it was he who had taken possession of the film. The Court then adjourned to the Censor Board film theatre where the trial judge viewed the film. At the resumption of the trial, Ashworth testified that on January 21, 1980, the film had been showing at the Capitol Square Cinema, before being transferred to the Jasper Cinema. While at the former theatre Ashworth had received about five phone calls from persons complaining about the film. In cross‑examination he was asked:  Did you find the movie very offensive to yourself?  He replied:  Yeah, I thought it was disgusting. That's only my personal...  The film itself and the evidence of Staff Sergeant Ashworth constituted the case for the Crown.  4.The defence called two witnesses. The first was Terrance Yushchyshyn, Director of Operations for the theatres operated by the accused company in the five westerly provinces. His evidence in summary was as follows. Prior to being booked into his theatre in Edmonton, the film, the subject of the present charge, had been shown at two Famous Players' Theatres, one in Edmonton, where it had been seen by 4065 persons and one in Calgary, where it had been seen by 4075 persons. The film was then moved to the Jasper Cinema where it was seen, before seizure, by 555 people, without complaints. In Mr. Yushchyshyn's opinion the impugned film was \"verypassé\", \"boring and dull\". Other films such asLast Tango in Paris, had far greater emphasis on sexual gratification.  5.Owen Garland Hooper is Chairman of the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. The Board views every film seen in Alberta. The Board allowedDracula Sucksto be shown in the province as a restricted adult movie, no one under the age of eighteen being admitted. The film was approved in the restricted adult category or equivalent by all of the provincial censor boards or classification boards across Canada. Mr. Hooper said that his Board had not made any deletions to the film. Most movies are \"pretty extensively cut when we get them\". This one had been edited in Toronto. The Board arrives at appropriate classification for a movie consistent with the Board's interpretation of current community standards of acceptance. Compared to other movies he had seen, Mr. Hooper describedDracula Sucksas \"pretty forgettable\". The Board had received no complaints regarding this particular film. During the preceding year, the Board viewed 750 films and rejected twelve, because it was felt that adult Albertans would generally repudiate them. The basis for the Board's assessment of community standards has shifted during the preceding ten years: now, \"it's contemporary, it's modern, it must be Canadian\". Mr. Hooper succinctly describedDracula Sucks: \"Well, it has nudity in it, it has violence in it, it has simulated sex encounters in it.\"  6.The trial judge found the film to be immoral, indecent and obscene. It possessed \"absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever\"; \"most of the film was devoted to extreme, tasteless violence and explicit, unnecessary sex\".  7.The accused company was convicted and fined $1500.

            "1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑The principal question with which this appeal is concerned is whether an intent to publish an obscene photograph is an essential element for the conviction of a person charged, under s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , that he \"unlawfully did make an obscene publication, to wit: a photograph of an act of gross indecency\".",
            "5.                The Crown appeal to the Court of Appeal (Howland C.J.O., Brooke and Cory JJ.A.) was allowed with Brooke J.A. dissenting (reported at (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 503). Howland C.J.O., for the majority, reviewed the authorities dealing with the construction of s. 159 and its predecessors. He came to the conclusion that publication was not an essential element of the charge. The word \"publication\" where used in the charge was, in his view, surplusage. He was also of the view that on a construction of s. 159(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  a separate offence of making an obscene photograph had been created. A conviction could be obtained therefore in the absence of evidence of an intent to publish. There was then evidence before the committing magistrate which would justify a committal and the committal order was restored. The majority was also of the view that the test for obscenity to be applied in cases under s. 159(1)(a) of the Code should be that set out in s. 159(8) whether publication was involved or not. This displaced the common law test of obscenity laid down by Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, at p. 371. Brooke J.A. (in dissent) expressed the view that, given the construction of s. 159 in its complete context, publication is an element in the commission of an offence under s. 159(1)(a). He would have upheld the reviewing court's order to quash. In this Court the argument centred on the question of publication and on the applicability of the test for obscenity under s. 159(8).",
            "The appellant was convicted and the conviction was upheld on a trial de novo. An appeal was taken to the Ontario Court of Appeal on the question of whether the obscenity test laid down in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  applied to the articles which were the subject matter of the case. The appellant's appeal was dismissed. The appellant appealed to this Court upon the following question of law:",
            "Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code  applied to the articles found by the trial judge to be obscene and that consequently the trial judge did not err in holding that s. 159(8) provided the sole test of obscenity in respect of those articles?",
            "7.                Laskin C.J., for the minority (the Chief Justice and Judson, Spence and Dickson JJ.), did not regard the offending articles as publications. He nevertheless concluded that the test in s. 159(8) should be applied in considering the question of obscenity. The Chief Justice expressed the view that where the Criminal Code  had provided the definitive test of obscenity which displaced the common law Hicklin test, then in the interests of consistency that test should be applied in all cases of obscenity. He would have applied the s. 159(8) test in obscenity cases not involving publications. He said, at pp. 962‑63:",
            "It is reasonable for a Court to apply the statutory standard, prescribed by Parliament as a definition of an offence of a generic character, when it is called upon to determine, in allied provisions of the Criminal Code , the sense in which the expression of some offence, made punishable in other circumstances, should be taken. Where no constitutional considerations are involved but only the interpretation and application of the words of Parliament, the judicial approach should be in the direction of consistency of meaning of the same word used by Parliament where that word is a designation of an offence which is a distributive one by reason of the specification of different situations in which it may be committed. So it is with obscenity in the various provisions of the Code under which it is an offence. If the issue under any of those provisions is sexual exploitation, either alone or in association with any of the subjects mentioned in s. 159(8), then I think it the proper course for this Court to apply in all such cases the standard or test that s. 159(8) prescribes for publications.",
            "It is my view that he was right in law to do so. In my opinion, the test of obscenity laid down in s. 159(8) should apply to the issue of obscenity in charges under the Criminal Code  whether based on publication or not. For the reasons outlined by Laskin C.J. in Dechow, the Hicklin test is no longer applicable in Canada in such cases.",

Criminal charges of forcible seizure and attempted escape were laid against the appellants, and on July 28, 1980 they were transferred to Kent Institution, a maximum security penitentiary, where they were placed in administrative dissociation or segregation on the oral instructions of the warden (hereinafter referred to as the \"Director\") of the institution, pursuant to s. 40(1)(a) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1251. Section 40 reads as follows:",
            "5.                The segregation of the appellants was reviewed once a month, in accordance with s. 40 of the Regulations, by a classification board called the Segregation Review Board, which was composed of members of the penitentiary staff. The appellants appeared before the Board. On October 7, 1980 the Board recommended to the Director that the appellants be returned to normal association with the general prison population. The Director declined to follow this recommendation. In its subsequent reviews of the appellants' case the Board maintained its favourable recommendation, but the Director continued to hold them in segregation. At the time their applications for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid were heard in November 1980, they had been in segregation for some four months, and the indication was that the Director would likely continue the segregation until disposition of the criminal charges against them.",
            "6.                In his affidavits filed in response to the appellants' applications for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and in his testimony on cross‑examination the Director indicated that he had ordered the segregation of the appellants because of what he had heard from the warden of Matsqui Institution and personnel at regional headquarters concerning the hostage‑taking incident, and that apart from these conversations he had not made, and he did not intend to make, an independent inquiry into the appellants' alleged involvement in the incident. He had decided not to follow the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board because, while he accepted its favourable opinion of the appellants' conduct in Kent Institution, he believed that their release from segregation before the disposition of the criminal charges against them would result in the \"probable\" or \"possible\" introduction of an unsettling element into the general population of the institution and was therefore not in the interests of the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. He could not point to a specific reason for holding this belief but based it on his personal assessment of the \"dynamics\" of the institution, a judgment which he referred to at one point as an \"instinctive reaction\" and con­ceded at another point could be described as a \"gut reaction\". He indicated that the primary consideration underlying his decision was the seriousness of the hostage‑taking incident in which the appellants were alleged to have been involved, and he could not point to any factor that would be likely to change his decision before the question of their involvement had been clarified by disposition of the criminal charges. It was not for him to determine that question when it was before the courts.",
            "I must, however, stress that the Order issued by Mahoney J. deals only with the jurisdiction of the Trial Division, not with the actual availability of the relief in the circumstances of the case. This is subject to the exercise of judicial discretion and in this respect it will be essential that the requirements of prison discipline be borne in mind, just as it is essential that the requirements of the effective administration of criminal justice be borne in mind when dealing with applications for certiorari before trial, as pointed out in Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen ([1979] 2 S.C.R. 305). It is specially important that the remedy be granted only in cases of serious injustice and that proper care be taken to prevent such proceedings from being used to delay deserved punishment so long that it is made ineffective, if not altogether avoided.",
            "17.              The procedural unfairness found by McEachern C.J.S.C. was in continuing the administrative segregation of the appellants, despite the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board that they be released into the general population of the penitentiary, without giving them notice of the reasons for refusing to follow that recommendation and an opportunity to be heard, including a chance to present their side of the hostage‑taking incident. McEachern C.J.S.C. also held that there was an appearance of unfairness in the apparently closed mind of the Director on the question of whether the segregation should be continued despite the favourable recommendation of the Board, and even a suggestion that the segregation was being continued in an attempt to force the appellants to plead guilty to the criminal charges pending against them. He said that the Director was required to make an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the hostage‑taking incident, to examine the appellants' files and to ascertain whether the continuation of the segregation was impairing their ability to instruct counsel, as they claimed. The heart of his conclusion on the issue of procedural fairness is contained in the following statement:"

Prompted by these observations, the military police officers placed Mr. Nolan in the back seat of the military police truck, drove him to the Military Police Section of C.F.B. Shearwater and Private Ettinger there issued a breathalyzer demand. The trial judge found as a fact that Private Ettinger had reasonable and probable grounds to issue the breathalyzer demand. Mr. Nolan was then driven to the Dartmouth Police Station where a breathalyzer technician was available to administer the test, but the appellant refused to take the breathalyzer test. No breathalyzer demand was ever issued to Mr. Nolan by a civilian police officer.  4.It is common ground that Mr. Nolan was a civilian at the time of his detention by the military police officers and that he was not subject to the Code of Service Discipline.  5.An Information was sworn charging that Mr. Nolan:  At or near C.F.B. Shearwater, in the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on or about the 5th day of June, 1981, did unlawfully, without reasonable excuse, refuse to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer, to provide samples of his breath suitable to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the proportion, if any, of alcohol in his blood, contrary toSection 235(2)of theCriminal Code.

        "Facts": " 6.At trial both parties agreed that it was the acts of Hill which caused the death of Pegg but dis­agreed otherwise. The position of the Crown at trial was that Hill and Pegg were homosexual lovers and that Hill had decided to murder Pegg after a falling out between them. The Crown argued that Hill deliberately struck Pegg in the head while Pegg lay in bed. This did not kill Pegg who immediately ran from the bedroom into the bathroom to try and stop the flow of blood from his head. Realizing he had been unsuccessful, Hill took two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.  7.Hill's version of the events was very different. He admitted to causing the death of Pegg but put forward two defences: self‑defence and provocation. Hill testified that he had known Pegg for about a year through the latter's involvement with the \"Big Brothers\" organization. Hill stated that on the night in question he had been the subject of unexpected and unwelcome homosexual advances by Pegg while asleep on the couch in Pegg's apartment. Pegg pursued Hill to the bathroom and grabbed him, at which time Hill picked up a nearby hatchet and swung it at Pegg in an attempt to scare him. The hatchet struck Pegg in the head. Hill then ran from the apartment but returned shortly afterward. Upon re‑entering the apartment, he was confronted by Pegg who threatened to kill him. At this point, Hill obtained two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.  8.Hill was arrested, after a car chase with the police, at the wheel of a Pontiac automobile owned by Pegg. At the scene of arrest Hill denied knowing Pegg, but later he made a statement to the police which was substantially similar to his oral testimony at trial.  II ",

I have read the evidence and I believe that he did not, in so concluding, commit an error of law. Indeed, this is an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, covered by s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which limits the appeal to grounds \"that involve [...] a question of law alone\". For the doubt entertained by the judge to amount to an error of law it must be the result of conjecture and have no basis whatever in the evidence. I have read the evidence, and such is not the case. For reasons which I will expand upon when considering the first count hereinafter, the trial judge had a reasonable doubt as to Asselin 's participation in the matter. Moreover, this is the only possible explanation, in view of Rousseau's acquittal on the count of conspiracy. For this reason, therefore, I would dismiss the appeal of the Crown on count 2.",
            "[TRANSLATION]  Between October 1, 1979 and January 30, 1980, at Ste‑Foy and at Québec, district of Québec, did conspire with Mr. Raymond Asselin to commit an indictable offence not provided for in section 423 (a), (b) and (c) of the Criminal Code , to wit: wilfully attempting to obstruct the course of justice, thereby committing an indictable offence specified in section 423 (d) of the Criminal Code .",
            "19.              The evidence could easily support certainty as to the existence of a conspiracy between Rousseau and the police officer, but its weight was not such that any doubt in this regard would constitute an error of law. First, there was no direct evidence as to the nature of the statements allegedly made by the lawyer to the police officer. At best, it can only be inferred from the observations made by the officer to the lawyer's clients and from his conduct in the matter. Furthermore, at the conclusion of his judgment, Bilodeau J., who has considerable experience in the practice of the criminal law and police operations, reveals his true thoughts in the following observations:",
            "20.              In reading the evidence, one finds certain references to the possible existence of a network of receivers, and others suggesting that the police were to some extent ready to deal with the \"small fry\" in order to get to the \"big guys\". This is a possibility which undoubtedly had some effect on Bilodeau J.'s belief as to the criminality of the police officer's participation in the lawyer's scheme; it explains his reference to the fact that the lawyer wished to \"obtain money\" by defrauding his clients and to the constraints imposed on the Crown by its choice of the charge. It is possible, and this is the possibility which created a doubt in the mind of Bilodeau J., that Rousseau converted into money for his own benefit and at the expense of his clients advantages which the police were willing to offer in exchange, not for money, but for information regarding the leaders of the network in the interests of the administration of justice. This possibility may not be one which would have created in the minds of all a doubt as to Asselin 's illegal participation in a conspiracy, but in view of the evidence as a whole I cannot say that to entertain such a doubt constitutes an error of law."
        ],
        "Facts": " 3.Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal related and analysed the facts in great detail in their judgments. I do not think it is necessary for me to do so in this judgment. I need only say the following. Rousseau is a lawyer. Three of his clients were involved in theft and receiving. Two of them worked for the security company which had the contract to protect the businesses where the thefts occurred.  4.The attempted obstruction of justice and conspiracy for that purpose arose from the fact that Rousseau allegedly agreed with the police officer responsible for the investigation of these crimes, a man named Asselin, to lay charges only for a part of them and to conceal the identities of the perpetrators from the authorities as to the remainder, in return for money obtained from his clients, money which Rousseau claimed was to be shared with the police officer.  5.The extortion was allegedly committed by a request made by the lawyer Rousseau to the lawyer of the security company for the sum of $10,000 to avoid publicity which, in connection with events involving employees, would have been bad for the company. The lawyer Rousseau allegedly said that he would be able to have the charges quietly dropped. The evidence of this request for money rested simply on the testimony of the company's lawyer.  6.The evidence relating to the other two counts is more complicated. Essentially, it consisted of conversations which Rousseau had with his clients, related at the trial by two of them, a discussion between Rousseau and the police officer, and finally statements made by the police officer to Rousseau's clients.  7.The trial judge disposed of the second and third counts quite briefly, saying simply that [TRANSLATION]  \"The evidence does not support a guilty verdict on counts 2 and 3.\" However, he undertook a meticulous and exhaustive analysis of the evidence on the charge of conspiracy. The following passage summarizes his analysis:  [TRANSLATION]  The evidence did not establish any agreement between Rousseau and Asselin in the presence of any other person. The content of the conversations which Rousseau may have had with Michel Hébert, Laurent Cyr, Boucher or Mr. Delisle, and which Asselin may have had with Cyr and Hébert, is so vague as to the intent of Rousseau and Asselin that the Court cannot definitely conclude that there was an agreement between Rousseau and Asselin to attempt to obstruct the course of justice by ensuring that Hébert and Cyr would only be charged with the theft of cigarettes.

At trial, the Crown adduced evidence to establish that Mr. Oakes was found in possession of eight one gram vials ofcannabisresin in the form of hashish oil.

Mr. Oakes told the police that he had bought ten vials of hashish oil for $150 for his own use, and that the $619.45 was from a workers' compensation cheque.

Pursuant to the procedural provisions of s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Act, the trial judge proceeded to make a finding that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Oakes was in possession of the narcotic.  4.Following this finding, Mr. Oakes brought a motion to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Act, which he maintained imposes a burden on an accused to prove that he or she was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking.

        "Facts": " 35.Appellant's third argument is also without foundation.  36.I would dismiss the appeal.  English version of the reasons delivered by  37.Wilson J.‑‑I agree with my colleagues Chouinard and La Forest JJ. that the appeal should be dismissed.  English version of the reasons of Le Dain and La Forest JJ. delivered by  38.La Forest J.‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Chouinard J., and I agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed. I also concur in his reasons. However, I would dispose of the first ground of appeal, concerning the meaning of the word \"obscene\" for the purposes ofs. 159of theCriminal Code, on a broader basis.  39.Section 159(2)(a), under which the accused was convicted, prohibits the sale or exposing to public view of obscene matter. In determining whether the articles in the possession of the accused for the purpose of sale were obscene Chouinard J., following Ritchie J. inDechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, first considered whether in the circumstances those articles were publications, since in that case the definition of obscenity with regard to publications, contained in s. 159(8), applies. As the articles were similar to those at issue inDechow, he concluded that they were obscene publications under that subsection.  40.Although it is possible to arrive at this conclusion by this means, I think that it is preferable to dispose of the question more directly. In my view obscenity has the same meaning whether or not the articles at issue are publications. It is true that the route taken by Chouinard J. had already been indicated by Ritchie J., who wrote the majority judgment inDechow; but inDechow, the charge was laid under s. 159(1), which deals primarily with publication and other activities of that kind. Section 159(2)(a), on the other hand, deals with the sale of articles and their exposure to public view. These articles may undoubtedly be publications. But can it reasonably be concluded that if the articles in question in the present case were not publications, a different meaning could be given to the word \"obscene\" in this provision? I do not think so. I share the view expressed by the late Laskin C.J., in his concurring reasons inDechow, that the word \"obscene\" must be given the same meaning whether or not the articles in question are publications, that is, the meaning which appears in s. 159(8).  41.For many years the courts relied on the definition of obscenity formulated inR. v. Hicklin(1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360. More recently, however, this definition has been seriously criticized both in the courts and in academic writings. InBrodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681, for example, Judson J. described it as \"vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to apply\". It is worth noting that in the recent decision inTowne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, Dickson C.J., in a judgment concurred in by Lamer and Le Dain JJ., said at p. 502:  It [the rule stated in s. 159(8)] supersedes rather than supplements the much‑criticized test enunciated by Cockburn C.J. inR. v. Hicklin. . . .  Although in that case the Chief Justice's observation concerned films, it nonetheless suggests that application of the old rule is questionable to say the least. In this state of flux, especially in a matter so related to public opinion as obscenity, the courts should pay particular attention to what is said by Parliament, even when it does not directly address the point at issue. This is especially true here, for if we applied the old definition to articles which are not publications, not only would we be giving a different definition to the word in the same provision, we would be applying a harsher definition in less serious circumstances, as for example in the case of a private sale by someone not a merchant.  42.It is true that the opinion of Ritchie J. inDechowwas a majority opinion. Nevertheless, he did not indicate that he disagreed with the reasons of Laskin C.J. Rather, he simply said, at p. 968, that he \"[did] not find it necessary to consider what test is to be applied in determining whether or not matters other than publications are obscene\". This was quite natural in the circumstances ofDechow, where the charge was based on s. 159(1) of theCode, dealing primarily with publications. That is not true in s. 159(2)(a), and the fact that a publication is involved in the case at bar is only a matter of chance.  Appeal dismissed.

        "Facts": " 3.The facts of the case are straightforward and undisputed. The six appellants are practising members of the Roman Catholic faith. They have for many years attended Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Our Lady of Lourdes is one of ninety‑three parishes which make up the Diocese of Antigonish.  4.It has become the custom in this diocese for communion to be received standing by those able to do so. This custom is a relatively recent development. The previous practice had been for communion to be received kneeling. This change has been accepted and approved by the Bishop responsible for the diocese.  5.Nonetheless, the appellants continued to oppose this change in the liturgy. As a result of their opposition, there has been what has been characterized before us as an ongoing dispute between the appellants on the one hand and the priests and other members of this church, on the other hand.  6.To aid in the resolution of this dispute, the parish priest and his assistant drew up a directive concerning the procedures to be followed during mass. This directive dealt in particular with the manner in which communion was to be administered and received. This directive was regularly read during services to the parishioners prior to the day of the alleged offence.  7.On that day as well, this directive was read to the assembled congregation, among whom were then present most, if not all, of the appellants. The directive was again read shortly before communion was administered by which time all appellants were present.  8.When the point in the mass had been reached when communion was to be taken, the appellants, with the other members of the congregation who desired to receive communion, made their way to the back of the church. From there, two lines formed and made their way down the centre aisle towards the three communion stations at or near the altar. The two lines spread into three as they approached these communion stations.  9.As each accused arrived at a communion station, he or she knelt before the priest. They were each told to stand if they wished to receive communion. After a few seconds, each one stood and, without receiving communion, moved off in an orderly manner to the sides of the church and returned to his or her seat. ",

        "Facts": " 3.The respondents owned and operated a manufacturing company, Casecam Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Casecam Manufacturing used the services of Yale & Partners, a firm of chartered accountants. In August of 1977 the respondents approached one Brian Rosenthal, a partner with Yale, seeking additional financing for Casecam Manufacturing. Mr. Rosenthal arranged for a group of investors to provide funds for a factoring scheme by which the respondents would sell Casecam Manufacturing's accounts receivable for cash and the buyer of the accounts receivable would collect the sum due from Casecam Manufacturing's clients.  4.Mr. Rosenthal arranged for a \"conduit\", in the form of a sole proprietorship called Casecam Financial Services, to channel funds from individual investors to Casecam Manufacturing. Casecam Financial Services was established in the name of Anna Teremy, Rosenthal's secretary and common‑law wife. The routine established was that when Casecam Manufacturing required funds, the respondent Kotler would notify Mr. Rosenthal or Ms. Teremy of the name and the amount of the receivables to be assigned. Mr. Rosenthal would then arrange for an individual investor to provide funds to Casecam Financial Services. A contract of assignment would be prepared, and the assignment would be registered. The respondents provided copies of the invoices for completed sales, and a cheque would be issued to the respondents in the name of Casecam Financial Services. The respondents in turn would issue a cheque to Casecam Financial Services for the first month's interest (2½ per cent per month), which was divided between Casecam Financial Services (½ per cent) and the individual investor (2 per cent).  5.In November 1977, the respondents acquired an interest in Gorlee Greenhouses, a division of Casecam Manufacturing. A similar factoring scheme was operated in relation to Gorlee Greenhouses, with a sole proprietorship called Gorlee Financial Services registered in Ms. Teremy's name and purchasing its accounts receivable.  6.These schemes operated until April or May of 1978, when it was discovered that the respondents had been submitting false invoices to Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services. These invoices totalled about $524,765. When confronted with this, the respondents made partial restitution ($80,000), but filed a corporate assignment in bankruptcy on May 29, 1978. The various individuals and companies who had invested in the factoring scheme suffered losses ranging from about $10,000 to $466,660. Ms. Teremy made a profit by reason of the fees received for her administrative services in relation to Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services.  7.The respondents were charged that they \"by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services of monies exceeding $200.00\".

Ciment Québec Inc. was dealing with the Provincial Bank, and Grégoire Doyon was one of the latter's managers.  Grégoire Doyon took an interest in their file and obtained financing from his bank which put Ciment Québec back on its feet.  Gustave Papillon, the president, directing mind and holder of the vast majority of shares in Ciment Québec Inc., appreciated Doyon's help and decided to reward him by paying him $3,000 a year for three years.  However, it was preferable not to make the payments directly to Doyon by Ciment Québec, and it was agreed that they would be made through the respondent, a young lawyer admitted to the Bar in November 1975, and the son‑in‑law of Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for fees to Ciment Québec.  Thus, $3,000 was paid in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.  As respondent had to pay tax on this income, after cashing the cheques he kept part to cover the additional tax he would have to pay and handed the remainder over to his father‑in‑law.  Grégoire Doyon of course received less than $9,000 as a result of these deductions, a fact to which, noted the judge, no one raised any objection.  The judge made another observation. The payments made to Grégoire Doyon were legitimate and caused no prejudice to Ciment Québec. In addition, the three participants were aware of the purpose of the lawyer's bills, and therefore no one was misled into believing that they were genuine documents.  3.Sections 324(1)and326(1)of theCriminal Codeare the applicable provisions in the case at bar:  324.(1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent  (a) that it should in any way be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one whether within Canada or not, or  (b) that some person should be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain from doing anything, whether within Canada or not.  326.(1) Every one who, knowing that a document is forged,  (a) uses, deals with, or acts upon it, or  (b) causes or attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act upon it,  as if the document were genuine, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

        "Facts": " 4.The Court of Appeal proceeded on the summary of the facts set out in Huband J.A.'s opinion and I propose to do the same. They are as follows:  On the early morning of March 10, 1982, the back door entrance of 655 Archibald Street, a building housing the business known as Ernie's Gun Shop Ltd., was tampered with and damaged. The silent alarm in the building was triggered and two police cruisers arrived at the scene within minutes of each other. The first officers who arrived disturbed two men in the vicinity of the rear entrance of the building. One of the men ran off in a northerly direction carrying what appeared to be a tire iron, and the second man ran off in a southerly direction, turning east toward Archibald Street. The individual with the tire iron was not apprehended, although a tire iron was located nearby the next morning. Paint chips on the tire iron were the same colour as the damaged door, and the iron itself appeared to fit into the nicks which had been created when the door was tampered with. The individual who ran off in a southerly direction was seen by police officers in a second police car, was followed by them, and ultimately apprehended. He is the accused, Schuldt.  All the police officers involved positively identified the accused, and the print of his footwear was matched with imprints in the snow around the back entrance of the gun shop. After his arrest Mr. Schuldt was interrogated by the police and made only one statement of any consequence, which was admitted in evidence. In response to a request to use the phone the investigating officers asked him what he wanted to use it for, and the accused replied, \"to phone home\", to which the police officer responded, \"to call your brother?\", to which Mr. Schuldt replied, \"He's a faster runner\".  5.Before entering upon an analysis of the trial judgment, I think it would be desirable to set out the sections that the trial judge was called upon to apply to the facts.  6.Section 306(1)(a) of theCriminal Codemakes it an offence to \"break[s] and enter[s] a place with intent to commit an indictable offence therein\".  7.Supporting the Crown in its burden of proving the intent for breaking and entering is s. 306(2)(a), which enacts that:  306.. . .  (2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused  (a) broke and entered a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence therein: . . .  8.The charge being one of attempt, regard must be had to s. 24:  24.(1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the circumstances to commit the offence.  (2) The question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law.  9.It is common ground that what was done to the door went beyond mere preparation. It is also common ground that the presumption of s. 306(2) is not triggered by an attempt, and we are, therefore, not invited to consider whether proof of a break coupled with proof of an intent to enter would beprima facieproof of an intent to commit therein an indictable offence. Indeed, the Crown adopted what was said inR. v. Johnson, a British Columbia Court of Appeal decision, reported at (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 101, (see alsoSt‑Jean v. The Queen(1974), 28 C.R.N.S. 1 (Que. C.A.)) Therefore, the Crown acknowledged that it had to make its case without the help of the presumption.  10.The Crown had to overcome three hurdles in order to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt:  (1) that the appellant was either directly forcing the door or, according tos. 21of theCriminal Code, was a party to what was done to the door, that is, aided or abetted the other person in forcing the door, or, formed a common intention to commit in the gun shop an indictable offence in circumstances where he knew, or should have known, that the carrying out of the common intention probably required breaking and entry;  (2) that what was done to the door was done with the intent to break and enter into the gun shop, and  (3) that the intended break and entry was accomplished for the further intent to commit therein an indictable offence.

            "1.                The Court‑‑In 1974, in Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399, this Court, speaking through Martland J., held that when s. 24(1)  of the Criminal Code  referred to \"an intent to commit an offence\" in relation to murder, it meant an intention to commit that offence in any of the ways provided for under s. 212 or s. 213 of the Code. The effect of the decision was that on an attempted murder charge the Crown could succeed, insofar as the mental element of the crime was concerned, on proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused either (i) meant to cause death or (ii) meant to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.",
            "10.              The judge noted upon sentencing that the testimony of the accused that a \"Dave X\" had administered the beatings without the knowledge or agreement of the accused was rejected by the jury in whole or in part, although it could not be said whether the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty as a principal, or as a party to a common purpose pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . We would add that it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury found that Mr. Wigman meant to cause death or that he had the lesser and now irrelevant intent, namely, that of meaning to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death or was reckless whether death ensued or not.",
            "The breaking and entering and robbery involved the accused entering the victims [sic] apartment, taking the woman's jewellery and money and using violence. The offence of attempted murder involved the accused striking the woman with one of the two intents set out in s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code , or at the very least, involved the accused in that he was a party to such an offence, pursuant to section 21(2) and section 212(a).",
            "16.              On the renewed hearing of the appeal, both the Kienapple issue and the Ancio issue were argued. The Crown makes three submissions. It contends that to entertain the Ancio issue would be to hear an appeal on an issue in respect of which no leave has been granted. It contends further that if leave should be granted, the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should in any event be applied in so far as it may be grounded in an attack on the judge's charge to the jury. Finally, it is contended that, should this Court not apply the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code to this appeal, it should substitute conviction for an offence under s. 228 of the Code as it stood on the date of the offence.",
            "20.              The appellant, however, submits that the charge of the trial judge to the jury conflicts with the new interpretation of the Criminal Code  given in Ancio. The inadequacy of the charge in this respect is not in doubt, as is conceded by the Crown. The main point in issue is whether the appellant can invoke what is now considered to be the correct interpretation of the Code.",
            "21.              The appropriate test is whether or not the accused is still in the judicial system. As expressed in the Crown's factum, this test affords a means of striking a balance between the \"wholly impractical dream of providing perfect justice to all those convicted under the overruled authority and the practical necessity of having some finality in the criminal process\". Finality in criminal proceedings is of the utmost importance but the need for finality is adequately served by the normal operation of res judicata: a matter once finally judicially decided cannot be relitigated. Thus a person convicted under Lajoie will not be able to reopen his or her case, unless, of course, the conviction is not final. In the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 757, the Court observed that res judicata would even preclude the reopening of cases decided by the courts on the basis of constitutionally invalid laws. The res judicata principle would apply with at least as much force to cases decided on the basis of subsequently overruled case law."

        "Facts": " 4.Mr. Wigman was charged with three counts of breaking and entering and robbery in an indictment dated October 26, 1981. Count #2 related to an apartment in the City of Vancouver in which Mrs. Margaret Hill resided. Mr. Wigman pleaded guilty to all three charges before Toy J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court.  5.On October 30, 1981, Mr. Wigman was charged with an attempted murder that took place during the break and enter incident cited in Count #2. Mrs. Hill, a 69 year old woman, lived alone in a ground floor apartment. She went to bed at 8:30 p.m. on May 16, 1981. A neighbour found her lying on the floor of her bedroom the next day at 4:00 p.m. and it was evident that she had suffered very severe injuries. The apartment was \"an awful mess\". A number of items had been taken. The telephone cord had been cut. Medical evidence indicated that she had been struck on the head at least six times and had enormous bruises on other parts of her body. She would likely have died without treatment. The fingerprints of the accused were found in the apartment.  6.The charge was heard by Toy J. and a jury. At the opening of the trial the accused, by his counsel, admitted that he, the accused, gained entry to Mrs. Hill's apartment by removing a sliding door from the apartment balcony, and that he stole various items of jewellery and a sum of money. There was no reference during the trial to Mr. Wigman's prior guilty plea to the break and enter charge. Nor was reference made to theKienappleargument that the accused could not be convicted of both the robbery charge and the attempted murder charge, the violence being common to both.  7.Mr. Wigman's defence to the attempted murder charge was that he had been accompanied by a person called \"Dave\" who had assaulted and severely beaten Mrs. Hill.  8.The judge charged the jury as to the requisite intent for attempted murder as follows:  . . . you can go either route, an intention to kill or an intention to cause bodily harm knowing that death may result and being reckless whether death ensues or not.  Words giving the jury the choice of two intents were repeated many times in the charge of the jury. This charge was in accordance withLajoie, but it now conflicts withAncio.  9.Toy J. left with the jury two included offences to the attempted murder charge: (1) causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life; and (2) assault causing bodily harm. The jury retired to deliberate at 5:12 p.m. on November 6, 1981 and returned at 5:28 p.m. on November 7, 1981 with a verdict of guilty of attempted murder.  10.The judge noted upon sentencing that the testimony of the accused that a \"Dave X\" had administered the beatings without the knowledge or agreement of the accused was rejected by the jury in whole or in part, although it could not be said whether the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty as a principal, or as a party to a common purpose pursuant tos. 21(2)of theCriminal Code. We would add that it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury found that Mr. Wigman meant to cause death or that he had the lesser and now irrelevant intent, namely, that of meaning to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death or was reckless whether death ensued or not.  11.On December 4, 1981, Toy J. sentenced the appellant to ten years in prison with respect to the charge of breaking and entering and committing robbery, and to life imprisonment with respect to the conviction on the charge of attempted murder.

He and the complainant were treated for relatively minor injuries and released from hospital. The appellant was thereupon charged with the offence which is the subject of this appeal, causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 306(1)(b) of theCode. While certain factual details are in issue, there was no dispute that the appellant did break into the complainant's home and did assault her.  4.The only defence advanced was lack of intent due to the appellant's voluntary consumption of alcohol. There was considerable evidence from both Crown and defence witnesses that the appellant was very drunk and acting very much out of character when he broke the window on the front door, unlocked it and forced his way into the apartment. The appellant testified he had not eaten all day, he had slept little in the previous four days, and he had consumed a great deal of alcohol between 8:00 p.m. on October 26th and 12:30 a.m. on October 27th. The defence also led expert psychiatric evidence to establish the effect of the appellant's consumption of alcohol on his mental processes considering the amount he had imbibed, his lack of sleep, and failure to eat that day.

            "2.                The accused appealed his convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal arguing reversible error below in the conduct of the trial and, subsidiarily, that a conviction, if any, could not be entered as regards some of the counts under the principle set out by this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. All agreed that there was error below, but the majority, applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , dismissed the appeal. Brooke J. A. dissenting, would not have applied the proviso and would have allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial. The judgment was released on November 17, 1983. No reference was made in the judgment to the issue regarding multiple convictions.",
            "5.                The issues in these appeals therefore divide into two parts. The first part concerns the application by the majority in the court below of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  to confirm a conviction under s. 143 of the Code for rape. The second part concerns the quashing by the Court of Appeal of the convictions on the other four counts in the indictment, as a result of an application of the principle set out in Kienapple, supra.",
            "6.                The issue arising out of the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  concerns the Crown's action in calling in reply the complainant and nine other witnesses to introduce evidence concerning the physical characteristics of the accused, particularly his mobility and agility, notwithstanding that he had an artificial limb from the knee down on one leg. The complainant testified in‑chief and in cross‑examination that the accused walked with a limp and had difficulty climbing the two flights of stairs to his dwelling. Indeed, the complainant admitted that in the course of the journey up the stairs, there was a possibility that she could have escaped by reason of the accused's difficulty except that she was frightened and this was probably due to the possession of a knife by the accused. Against the backdrop of this evidence, the accused elected to testify and he did nothing to disturb the complainant's description of his restricted ability to move about. Indeed, he may have emphasized the complainant's evidence by limping to the witness stand. In reply, other witnesses called by the Crown contradicted the essence of the complainant's testimony as to the difficulties the accused had in walking by reason of his artificial limb. The Crown could not have called these witnesses to contradict its own witness, the complainant Volk. To allow the Crown to do so in reply is doubly wrong because the effect was to force the accused to return to the witness box. When the Crown called the complainant in reply, she testified about a new topic which had nothing whatever to do with any evidence entered by the accused or on behalf of the accused in his defence. She proceeded to tell the jury about a statement alleged to have been made by the accused to her that he \"had planned... [the offence] for a week and it could have been anyone\". The effect of this evidence on a juror's mind would in all likelihood be serious. It is of course impossible to reconstruct this trial by jury so as to determine what the verdict would have been had this evidence not been presented. This information did not fall out of the complainant accidentally, as the very form of the Crown's question indicates an awareness of the answer desired. Indeed, counsel for the Crown, in proper frankness, acknowledged that this was the case. Clearly this is the situation referred to in criminal practice as the prosecution splitting its case. The wrongs which flow from such a practice are manifold and the practice has been prohibited from the earliest days of our criminal law.",
            "8.                These are the consequences that flow from a violation of one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal process, namely the dividing of the prosecution's case so as to sandwich the defence. This is a particularly lethal tactic where the evidence in reply raises a new issue and attacks the accused's credibility for this is the last evidence which the members of the jury hear prior to their deliberations. It also raises the question as to the propriety of the Crown's conduct in the context of the accused's right to elect to remain silent or to elect to enter the witness box in his own defence. He must be given the opportunity of making this decision in the full awareness of the Crown's complete case. This did not occur in these proceedings.",
            "9.                Section 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  cannot be invoked in these circumstances. The reviewing tribunal cannot, with anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth of the residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been extracted from the record. The appellate tribunal does not have the advantage of seeing the witnesses, and in any case, was never intended in the criminal process to replace the jury. It is unnecessary to reopen the many authorities in this Court on the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  because the situation resulting from the trial in these proceedings fails to qualify under any of these authorities for the application of the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii)."

        "Facts": " 2.The appellant, Barry Graham Moore, and two other people, not parties to this appeal, were charged in an eight‑count information with various counts of theft and possession of stolen property. The possession charges were laid under s. 312(1) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, which reads:  312.(1) Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or of the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from  (a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment; . . .  3.Count 6 of the information, the count with which we are in this appeal particularly concerned, reads:  count6The informant also says that he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that Barry Graham MOORE, on or about the 27th day of February A.D., 1981, at or near the Town of Williams Lake, County of Cariboo and Province of British Columbia, did UNLAWFULLY have in his possession, automobile parts, the property of Zora Enterprises Ltd. of a value exceeding two hundred dollars,  CONTRARY TO THE FORM OF STATUTE IN SUCH CASE MADE AND PROVIDED  4.It will be noted that the information lacks the averment of an essential element of the offence, namely that Moore knew that the property had been obtained from the commission in Canada of an indictable offence. Moore entered a plea of not guilty to the charges against him and elected to be tried by a magistrate without a jury.  5.When the matter came on for trial, the trial judge, Smith Prov. Ct. J., asked defence counsel if he had any submission to make. The judge also asked Crown counsel if he had any comments on the information. Counsel made no comment. The judge then pointed out the defect and asked defence counsel if he had a motion to quash unders. 529of theCriminal Code. Defence counsel promptly argued that the counts disclosed no offence known to law. The trial judge and Crown counsel agreed with that submission. Defence counsel moved that the defective counts be quashed. Crown counsel moved that the pleas be struck to permit the Crown to amend the information pursuant to s. 529. The trial judge asked if it was possible to strike the pleas, and Crown counsel agreed that the court could not. Defence counsel then argued that since the counts simply failed to allege an offence, rather than alleging one improperly, it was not possible to amend them at all. Again the judge and Crown counsel agreed with this statement and the judge quashed the defective counts.  6.A new information containing the necessary words omitted from the earlier information was subsequently sworn. When trial on that information began, Moore entered pleas ofautrefois acquiton the possession counts. The second trial judge, Barnett Prov. Ct. J., refused the special pleas because he accepted the Crown's submission that the counts in the first information had been \"hopelessly bad\". He ruled that since there had never been any allegation of criminal misconduct, the appellant had never been in peril of conviction. The first essential for a special plea ofautrefois acquitwas not present and the plea was not available. Moore then entered pleas of not guilty to the two charges. He was convicted on count  6. An appeal was taken to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  II ",

        "Facts": " 2.On January 1, 1981, Sandra Prince, by means of a single blow to the abdomen stabbed Bernice Daniels. At the time Daniels was six months pregnant. On January 2, 1981, Prince was charged with the attempted murder of Daniels. On January 6, 1981, Daniels gave birth to a child who lived for 19 minutes and then died. The cause of death is alleged to be traceable to the stabbing. The autopsy report indicated that the knife penetrated the amniotic sac, causing contamination of the amniotic fluid which in turn caused the child's premature birth. Because the fetus was not sufficiently developed, the child died.  3.Between December 7, 1981, and January 4, 1982, Prince was tried and acquitted of the attempted murder of Daniels but was convicted on a charge of causing bodily harm to Daniels. An appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal in respect of her conviction and sentence (six months imprisonment) was dismissed on October 20, 1982.  4.In the meantime, on July 1, 1981, following an inquest into the death of the child, and following Prince's committal for trial on the charge of attempted murder of Daniels, Prince was charged with manslaughter of the child as follows:  THAT she, the said SANDRA PRINCE, between the thirty‑first day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty, and the seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty‑one, both dates inclusive, at the City of Winnipeg, in the Eastern Judicial District, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully cause death to the unnamed male child of Bernice Daniels, and did thereby commit manslaughter.  A preliminary inquiry regarding this charge was held in February, 1982, and Prince was committed to stand trial. On April 29, 1983, Prince's lawyer made a preliminary motion to the trial judge, Barkman Co. Ct. J., requesting him to enter a stay of proceedings on the basis of the principle inKienapple v.

        "Facts": " 2.On August 28, 1980, Schmidt, with the assistance of her son, Charles Gress, and a friend of his, Paul Hildebrand, is alleged to have abducted a two‑year old girl, Denise Gravely, from a Cleveland sidewalk. Schmidt took the child with her to New York State, where she kept her for almost two years, raising her as her daughter. In the interim, the child's father committed suicide, allegedly as a result of his inability to discover his child's whereabouts.  3.On March 22, 1982, Schmidt attended a family reunion in Buffalo, New York, accompanied by Denise. Another son of hers, Donald Gress, was also at the reunion. By sheer coincidence, Donald Gress not only came from Cleveland but knew the child's parents and had helped to search for her after her abduction. Following the reunion, he told Cleveland police of Denise's whereabouts and she was returned to her mother on March 26, 1982.  4.Following her arrest, Schmidt was charged with the federal offence of kidnapping and the state offence of child‑stealing. Grand juries returned indictments on both charges, on March 29, 1982 on the state charge and on March 31, 1982 on the federal charge.  5.The two charges have some similarities but they also have important differences. The federal offence under theUnited States Code, Title 18 reads:  §1201. Kidnapping  (a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof, when:  (1) the person is willfully transported in interstate or foreign commerce;  (2) any such act against the person is done within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;  (3) any such act against the person is done within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 101(36) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1301(36)); or  (4) the person is a foreign official, an internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are defined in section 1116(b) of this title,  shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.  The offence under theRevised Code of Ohioreads:  §2905.04‑‑Child Stealing  (A) No person, by any means, and with purpose to withhold a child under the age of fourteen or mentally incompetent from the legal custody of his parent, guardian or custodian, shall remove such child from the place where he is found.  (B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor reasonably believed that his conduct was necessary to preserve the child's health or welfare.  6.On July 26, 1982, Schmidt was tried on the federal charge by a judge and jury. She admitted the abduction, but contended that she had taken part in it in the belief that Denise was the illegitimate daughter of her son Donald Gress, and that she had been abandoned by her father and was living with her natural mother \"in a home of ill repute\". On July 30, 1982, the jury found Schmidt not guilty and she was acquitted.  7.On August 6, 1982, while the state offence of child‑stealing was still pending, Schmidt, who is a Canadian citizen, left the United States and came to Canada. She was arrested in Kirkland Lake, Ontario on August 30, 1982 and extradition proceedings against her were begun pursuant to the Canada‑United States extradition treaty.  8.I should add that Schmidt's counsel argues that if Schmidt is returned to Ohio, she will not have the benefit of raising her previous federal prosecution in bar of her prosecution under state law. While under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a person is protected from double jeopardy against federal prosecutions, that provision does not apply to the states although at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a state would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: seeBartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). It is clear, however, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not automatically protect an individual from being prosecuted under a state law although the accused was earlier tried and acquitted of an offence under federal law. Thus inBartkus v. Illinois,supra, the accused was tried and acquitted under a federal law of robbing a federally insured bank. He was later tried and convicted on substantially the same evidence in an Illinois state court for violating an Illinois robbery statute. On an action to test the constitutionality of the second prosecution, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois prosecution did not violate the due process clause. ",

Pursuant to Mr. Libman's directions the sales personnel telephoned United States residents and attempted to induce them to purchase shares in two companies, Hebilla Mining Corporation and Claravella Corporation, which purported to be engaged in gold mining in Costa Rica. In addition to the telephone representations, the United States residents also received promotional material which was mailed from Panama City, Panama and San José, Costa Rica by associates of Mr. Libman.  4.The telephone sales personnel, on the direction of Mr. Libman, made material misrepresentations with respect to their identity, where they were telephoning from, and the quality and value of the shares they were selling. As a result of these misrepresentations, a large number of United States residents were induced to purchase shares in the two mining companies. There was some evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry from which it could be inferred that these shares were virtually worthless.  5.The United States residents who agreed to purchase shares were told by the telephone sales personnel to send their money to offices operated by Mr. Libman's associates in either San José, Costa Rica or Panama City, Panama. There was evidence tendered that Mr. Libman went to a location outside Canada, usually Costa Rica or Panama, to meet with his associates and receive his share of the proceeds of the sale of the shares. Mr. Libman then brought this money back to Toronto and distributed a portion of it to his sales personnel. There was also evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry with respect to the wire transfer of monies from Panama City to Mr. Libman in Toronto. ",

The evidence disclosed that Schwartz had bought the two handguns in 1978 from one of his employees, Horst Schimiczek, who had acquired the .38 Special in Texas and the .44 Magnum in North Dakota. Schimiczek had moved to Winnipeg, duly registered the two weapons, and then sold the guns to Schwartz. He gave Schwartz the registration papers, in Schimiczek's name. Later, an application in Schwartz's name for a firearms acquisition certificate, the necessary first step to obtain a registration certificate, was received by the Firearms Section of the City of Winnipeg Police Department. At the time, the Firearms Section was under control of Staff Sergeant Gordon Pilcher, who reviewed the application and determined that a notice of intention to refuse a firearms acquisition certificate should be sent to Schwartz. A notice to this effect was delivered to Schwartz by double registered mail.  3.Approximately nine months after the notice was mailed, members of the Winnipeg Police Department executed a search of Schwartz's home, and located and confiscated a .44 Magnum and a .38 Special.  4.Schwartz proceeded to trial before Allen Prov. Ct. J. and was convicted on both charges. He was fined $50 on each charge. On appeal, Barkman Co. Ct. J. allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Crown then appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (Hall J.A., Matas J.A. concurring, and Huband J.A. dissenting in part). The acquittals were set aside and convictions restored. Leave was granted by this Court to appeal the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.  II ",

        "Facts": " 2.The appellant was charged in Alberta with second degree murder. At his trial before Rowbotham J. sitting with a jury, the appellant gave evidence in his defence, admitting that he had killed the deceased but also alleging certain circumstances of justification. The appellant did not invoke the protection of s. 5 of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. The appellant was convicted, but successfully appealed the conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal and was granted a new trial on grounds of misdirection to the jury: (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 494. At the new trial, the Crown read in the appellant's testimony from the first trial over the objection of appellant's counsel, such objection based ons. 13of theCharter. The appellant chose not to testify nor did he call any evidence. He was again convicted. He appealed again to the Alberta Court of Appeal on the sole ground that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence, as part of the Crown's case, the testimony of the appellant from his former trial. The appeal was dismissed: (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453, 9 C.R.R. 61, 39 C.R. (3d) 281, 31 Alta. L.R. (2d) 16, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 589, 51 A.R. 210, [1984] 3 W.W.R. 594.

        "Facts": " The appellant was at all material times a Constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. On August 21, 1981, one Donald Kerr was brought to the R.C.M.P. detachment in Yorkton, Saskatch‑ ewan for a breathalyzer test. Kerr was taken into a room where he met the appellant.  The appellant started to question Kerr concerning the incident giving rise to his arrest. He asked Kerr who was driving the car at the time. Kerr indicated that his sister was driving. The appellant suspected he was lying. He repeated the question a couple of times, receiving the same response each time. The appellant then grabbed Kerr, who was seated in a chair at the time, by the throat and pushed him against a wall. The grab around the throat was sufficient to cause a choking sensation to Kerr.  After a few seconds the appellant questioned Kerr again as to who was driving the car. Kerr continued to maintain that his sister was driving. The appellant slapped Kerr across the face with his open hand and repeated the question. Kerr gave the same answer. However, after three or four slaps Kerr admitted that he had been driving the car. At no time did Kerr respond physically to the appellant's slaps. The defence has admitted, on these facts, that the appellant committed a common assault as defined in theCriminal Code. As a result of the assault Kerr suffered a sore throat, a ringing in his ears, and several minor marks on his face.  Two charges were laid following this incident. On August 21, 1981 the appellant was charged with common assault contrary to s. 245(1) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. The appellant was also charged under theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Actas follows:  That at or near Yorkton, in the Province of Saskatchewan, on the 21st day of August, 1981, that you were unnecessarily violent towards a prisoner, to wit: Donald Kerr, by forcibly grabbing him and slapping him in the face, contrary to Section [sic] (L), Section 25 of theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Act.

For a second or subsequent offence, the accused is, under s. 235(2), liable to a greater punishment. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asked that the court impose a greater punishment because of previous convictions and established that notice had been given to the accused prior to his plea in compliance withs. 740of theCriminal Codewhich requires that in order to impose a greater punishment the court must be satisfied that the defendant, before making his plea, was notified that, upon conviction, a greater punishment would be sought.  3.As actual proof of the convictions, the Crown simply produced a document entitled \"Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving Record\" pursuant to s. 75 of theMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288 (as amended by S.B.C. 1982, c. 36, s. 16). The document listed previous convictions. The accused objected to the production of the document on three grounds:  a)                that said Notice of Greater Punishment lacked                    sufficient particularity;  b)                that he was not sufficiently identified in the                          \"Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving                    Record\";  c)                that the \"Certified Extract of British Columbia                     Driving Record\" was not admissible at common law as                retained bys. 7(2)of theCriminal Codedespite s.            75 of theMotor Vehicle Actof B.C. and s. 37 of                    theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

There was a struggle between the accomplice and a client. A shot was fired and the client was killed. The accomplice managed to escape and has never been found.

On the night of the robbery, however, the accomplice arrived at their meeting place with a gun. The appellant said that he objected because, on a previous armed robbery, his gun had discharged accidentally, and he did not want that to happen again. He insisted that the gun be unloaded. The accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to the appellant. The appellant then went to the bathroom and placed the bullets in his glove. The glove was recovered by the police at the scene of the crime and was found at trial to contain three bullets. The appellant testified that, at the time of the robbery, he was certain that the gun was unloaded. ",

        "Facts": " 53.In 1968, the Nova Scotia Liberal Association created a finance committee to raise funds for the purposes of the party. The Committee was composed of the appellant, as chairman, and MacFadden and Simpson who acted primarily as collectors. Two bank accounts were opened by the Committee for the purpose of receiving financial contributions. The accounts were in the name of Cambridge Investments and J. G. Simpson, in trust. The signing authorities on the Cambridge account were Simpson and MacFadden and, on the other, Simpson and his secretary. Monies collected or received were deposited to these accounts and then disbursed to several trust funds which had been set up over the years for the purposes of the Nova Scotia liberal party, to various individuals and the Nova Scotia Liberal Association. The common trustee of all the trust funds was the appellant.  54.According to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which on this point is not challenged, the evidence, particularly documentary evidence, showed clearly that the appellant and his co‑accused were at all times aware of the flow of cash through both bank accounts. Meticulous accounting records were kept with respect to the two accounts and none of the monies disbursed from the accounts or the various trust funds was expended by the appellant or his two co‑accused for their own use or benefit. The evidence also revealed a close relationship between the members of the Committee, as well as a close connection between the committee members and government officials from whom they received information relating to such matters as the identity of those who were doing business with the Government of Nova Scotia.  55.In October of 1970, the liberal party defeated the then Government of Nova Scotia in a general election and formed the new government which held power until 1978. During the period from 1970 to 1978, the Committee collected contributions amounting in total to $3,836,468.13, of which $2,770,773.52 was deposited in one bank account and $1,065,694.61 in the other. A police investigation commenced in the autumn of 1978 resulted in the seizure of many documents from government departments and agencies and also from several wineries, distilleries and other corporations. The evidence revealed that the contributions made by liquor and wine companies dealing with the government were based on a fixed amount per case of products sold to the Government. Other companies doing business with the government paid a percentage of monies they received from government work which ranged from three to five per cent.  56.The theory of the Crown was that the monies contributed to the Committee were not, in fact, bona fide political contributions but were payments made by them to ensure the continuation of their business relationship with the Government. To secure these contributions, the appellant and his two accused, out of their desire to support the liberal party in Nova Scotia, agreed among themselves to \"peddle their influence with the Government\" to the various companies doing business with the Government. The appellant defended on the basis that his character and reputation refuted the charge against him. It was said that the whole case for the Crown was an attempt to involve the appellant in conduct of the co‑accused Simpson in which he was in no way involved. The appellant did not contend before the Court of Appeal, nor does he in this Court, that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. He raised four grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal and raised the same grounds in this Court. They are set out hereunder:  1. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial Judge's examination under oath of members of the jury panel on April 5, 1983 in the absence of the appellant (and his counsel) did not vitiate the appellant's trial.  2. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the Nova Scotia Liberal Association is a \"person\" within the meaning ofSection 110(1)(d) of theCriminal Code of Canada.  3. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial Judge's instructions to the jury, referable to the co‑conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule were correct.  4. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the learned Trial Judge's failure to instruct the jury as to the use, in law, that could be made of evidence of Senator Barrow's good character.  I will address the grounds in that order. ",

        "Facts": " 2.On September 23, 1983, the appellant, Thomas Patrick Lyons, was arraigned on an information containing four charges: unlawfully breaking and entering a dwelling house contrary tos. 306(1)(b) of theCriminal Code; unlawfully using a weapon or imitation thereof in committing a sexual assault, contrary to s. 246.2(a) of theCode; unlawfully using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, contrary to s. 83(1)(a) of theCode; and unlawfully stealing property of a total value exceeding $200, contrary to s. 294(a) of theCode. These offences were alleged to have been committed approximately one month after the appellant's sixteenth birthday.  3.The appellant elected trial by a judge without a jury on all four charges and waived his right to a preliminary inquiry. He subsequently entered pleas of guilty to all counts in the indictment. O Hearn Co. Ct. J. of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for District No. 1, Nova Scotia, requested a pre‑sentence report and adjourned the matter of sentence.  4.Just before the sentence hearing on November 4, 1983, defence counsel was informed, for the first time, that the Crown might bring a dangerous offender application under Part XXI of theCode. At the commencement of the hearing, the Crown requested and was granted an adjournment to permit it to consider bringing such an application. The application was subsequently made. On November 8, 1983, consent to the application was obtained from the Deputy Attorney General of Nova Scotia, as required by s. 689(1)(a) of theCode.  5.At the commencement of the hearing of the application on December 14, 1983, an agreed upon statement of facts was read into the record. Evidence, including expert psychiatric testimony, was tendered on behalf of both the Crown and the appellant.  6.Though O Hearn Co. Ct. J. had at the outset warned the Crown attorney that he would have an \"uphill fight\" owing to the age of the appellant, the judge in the end found, on the basis of medical and other evidence presented to him, that it had been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant qualified as a dangerous offender under the provisions of theCode. In his view, it had been shown that the appellant had a \"sociopathic personality\" and had so little conscience that it did not govern his actions. He concluded that it could be said with \"a high degree of confidence\" that it was \"very likely\" that the appellant would constitute a danger to the psychological or physical health and lives of others owing to \"his in‑built, perhaps congenital indifference to the consequences to others, his lack of affect, his lack of feeling for others\". He belonged, the judge stated, to a class of people who, though mentally able to understand the law and to conform their conduct to its dictates, are so irresponsive to the law that they must be dealt with by extraordinary measures.  7.O Hearn Co. Ct. J. also considered and rejected the appellant's contentions that Part XXI of theCodewas constitutionally invalid as offending against the guarantees embodied inss. 7,9and12of theCharter, and proceeded to sentence the appellant to an indeterminate period of detention in a penitentiary.  8.The appellant's appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, was unanimously dismissed for reasons given by Macdonald J.A. On January 31, 1985, leave to appeal to this Court was granted.  9.The following constitutional questions were stated by the Court on March 26, 1985:  1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Codeof Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the rights guaranteed by ss. 7, 9, 11 and/or 12 of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Code, in whole or in part, justified on the basis ofs. 1of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsand therefore not inconsistent with theConstitution Act, 1982?  10.The appellant also argued that his rights unders. 7of theCharterwere violated by the Crown's failure to give him notice, before his election of a mode of trial and the entry of his plea, that it intended to bring, or contemplated bringing, a \"dangerous offender\" application under Part XXI of theCode.  11.The Attorneys General of Canada, Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan intervened in support of the constitutional validity of Part XXI.

            "1                                                         McIntyre J. ‑‑ The appellant was found guilty before a judge and jury of murdering his two adopted children. He appeals to this Court on the ground that the verdict should be set aside, pursuant to s. 613 (l)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code  which enables a court of appeal to allow an appeal against a conviction \"where it is of the opinion that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence\". The issue before this Court, then, is the proper interpretation and application of s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code.",
            "16                                                      An appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (Craig, Macdonald and Hutcheon JJ.A.) was dismissed with Hutcheon J.A. dissenting. The sole ground of appeal in the Court of Appeal was that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or that it could not be supported on the evidence, pursuant to s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code . Craig J.A. followed Corbett v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275, and stated that the test under s. 613(1)(a)(i) is \"whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered\". He found that the verdict was reasonable, stating:",
            "18                                                         Hutcheon J.A., in dissent, also saw Corbett as the governing decision but, like Macdonald J.A., found Pigeon J.'s statement of the law to be somewhat unclear. In Corbett, Pigeon J. stated, at p. 279, that the test under s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code  is whether \"the verdict is such that no twelve reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially\". Later, at p. 282, he stated that the test is \"whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered\". Hutcheon J.A. thought that the word \"possibly\" in the first formulation was inappropriate and he adopted Pigeon J.'s second formulation as a more faithful rendition of the law. Applying this test, he concluded that the jury's verdict was unreasonable. He was of the view that evidence of motive was insignificant and that there was insufficient evidence to justify a finding of exclusive opportunity on the part of Yebes. In conclusion, he stated that \"the cumulative effect of the facts on which motive and opportunity are based does not support\" the proposition that Yebes' guilt was the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence.",
            "20                                                      As a general proposition, the verdict at trial will stand where there is evidence before the jury going in proof of all elements of the offence and where the trial judge has properly charged the jury on all matters of law which arise in the case and has made such references to the evidence as may be necessary to facilitate the application of the law to the facts. However, s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code  provides an additional basis for the challenging of the verdict at trial. A court of appeal may allow an appeal against a conviction where it is of the opinion that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. It may be thought that this subsection does not in a strict sense raise a question of law which would give a right to appeal to this Court under s. 618(1)(a) of the Code. Indeed, the respondent Crown asserted in its factum that there was no point of law dividing the minority and the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case. This argument was not, however, strongly pressed on the hearing of the appeal and, in my view, cannot be sustained. It is frequently difficult to draw a clear line between a question of law and a question of fact. While the law can be stated in isolation from the facts, abstract statements of law unconnected to facts are vague and elusive. Even when two judges state the law in precisely the same terms each may actually differ in his understanding of the law and the requirements for its application. Therefore, whether or not an appeal raises a question of law can only be determined after an examination of both the statements of law and the application of the law to the facts in the courts below. Under s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code, a court of appeal is required to decide whether the verdict of the jury was unreasonable. While this involves a reconsideration of the facts, it also requires the court to resolve a question of law by giving legal content to the concept of \"unreasonable\". This same point was made recently by this court in Mahoney v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, where the Court was called upon to determine whether a question of law is raised by the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) which allows the Court to dismiss an appeal notwithstanding an error of law at trial, provided that \"no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred\". Speaking for Laskin C.J., Ritchie and Estey JJ., and myself, I stated, at pp. 852‑53, that:",
            "The authorities which have been referred to make                                     it clear, in my view, that this Court has long considered that the application of the proviso involves a question of law and it has entertained appeals where error in its application has been alleged. It has been shown that the proviso may be applied only following a legal determination that errors have been made at trial, but that \"no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred\", and then only according to a strict legal test. The determination of what will constitute a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice must involve the construction of those words in the context in which they are used in the Statute, and such statutory construction has long been considered a matter of law. The Court's decision involves an analysis of the rights accorded by law to an accused and the measurement of the impact of the errors which were made at trial. Once an appellant establishes in the Court of Appeal that errors of law were made at his trial he becomes entitled to have his appeal allowed and a new trial or an acquittal, depending on the circumstances, unless the proviso is applied to annul those rights. The Court of Appeal must consider the errors against the background of the whole trial. While a reconsideration of the evidence is involved, clearly the inquiry goes far beyond the determination of matters of fact.  The Court of Appeal must give substance to the concept of \"miscarriage of justice\" and this involves a legal determination. For all the above reasons, I am of the opinion that the application of the proviso must always involve a question of law and it is reviewable in this Court on appeal under s. 618 of the Criminal Code . [Emphasis added.]",
            "While the reasons of the majority in Mahoney were based on s. 613(1)(b)(iii), I believe that they are equally applicable to s. 613(1)(a)(i) and, therefore, following those reasons I am of the view that s. 613(1)(a)(i) raises a question of law which can be reviewed by this Court under s. 618 of the Criminal Code .",
            "21                                                         The leading case upon the question of the applicability of s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code  is Corbett v. The Queen, supra. In that case, Corbett was convicted of murder. The key witness was the wife of the deceased. She had been wounded by the murderer immediately after the shooting of her husband, but three days after the shooting was able to identify Corbett as the killer. There were, however, some discrepancies between her statement of the facts and the evidence of other witnesses. The case was appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the ground that the discrepancies in the evidence made the verdict \"unreasonable\" for the purposes of s. 613(1)(a)(i). The appeal was dismissed with a dissent concerning the application of s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the Code. In this Court, Pigeon J., speaking for the majority (Abbott, Martland, Judson, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.) (Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting) said that the dissent in the Court of Appeal was not a dissent upon a question of law but solely as to the application of law. This raised the same question to which I have already adverted. Responding to a submission by the appellant that the majority of the Court of Appeal, in their approach to s. 613(1)(a)(i), erred in merely considering whether there was any evidence rather than reaching their own conclusion on the weight of the evidence, he said, at pp. 278‑79:",
            "22                                                         These passages, especially those portions underlined, have led to some uncertainty regarding the standard of review to be employed under s. 613  of the Criminal Code . As I have indicated above, the judges of the Court of Appeal were troubled by the apparent inconsistencies in these passages and attempted to resolve them. Hutcheon J.A., in dissent, concluded that the word \"possibly\", used in the first passage, was inappropriate and that the last of the quoted passages stated the law more faithfully. Macdonald J.A., on the other hand, after citing the first of the passages quoted above, said with a hint of resignation:",
            "25                                                      In my view, the majority of the Court of Appeal did not fail to apply the correct principles relating to the treatment of circumstantial evidence. The function of the Court of Appeal, under s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence to support a conviction. The Court must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the Court must re‑examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence. This process will be the same whether the case is based on circumstantial or direct evidence. In the Court of Appeal, the majority clearly found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the verdict and both Macdonald and Craig JJ.A. rejected all rational inferences offering an alternative to the conclusion of guilt. It is therefore clear that the law was correctly understood and applied.",
            "31                                                      For the reasons given above, I would conclude that the majority of the Court of Appeal were not in error in their application of s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code . They correctly applied the test in Corbett and I would dismiss the appeal."

        "Facts": "  Later, at p. 280, he said:   In my view, there is nothing from which it might                                          be deduced that the learned judge only considered whether there was evidence. If there had been no evidence, it would have been the duty of the trial judge to withhold the case from the jury. This is not what was considered. The point dealt with assumed that the case was properly before the jury. It was asked in effect whether they could reasonably answer \"Guilty\" and, in my opinion, that was the proper test before the Court of Appeal.   And in reaching his conclusion, he said, at p. 282:  ",

        "Facts": " 3.On July 13, 1982 at about 1:30 in the afternoon the respondent Marc‑André Paré, then 17 years old, met Steeve Duranleau, a seven‑year‑old boy. At Paré's suggestion the two went swimming. After about fifteen minutes in the pool Paré offered to take Duranleau to look at some used cars. The offer was only a pretence. Paré's real motive was to get Duranleau alone in order to have sexual relations with him.  4.After changing, Paré and Duranleau went to a parking lot where they looked at some used cars. Near the parking lot was a bridge that crossed the St. Charles River. Paré lured Duranleau under the bridge. Duranleau wanted to leave but Paré told him not to and held him by the arm. Paré sat there for the next ten minutes holding Duranleau by the arm. Then Paré told Duranleau to lie on his back and to keep quiet. Paré pulled Duranleau's shorts down and lowered his own pants and underwear. He then lay on top of Duranleau and indecently assaulted him. After ejaculating beside Duranleau's penis, Paré sat up and got dressed.  5.At this point Duranleau told Paré that he intended to tell his mother about the incident. Paré told him that he did not want him to tell his mother and that, if he did, he would kill him. After this exchange of words Paré was certain that the boy would tell his mother as soon as he could. Paré made Duranleau lie on his back. He waited for two minutes with his hand on Duranleau's chest. He then killed Duranleau by strangling him with his hands, hitting him on the head several times with an oil filter, and strangling him with a shoe‑lace.  6.The accused was charged as follows:  [TRANSLATION]  That in Québec City, Quebec, on or around July 13, 1982, he illegally and intentionally killed Steeve Duranleau, thereby committing murder in the first degree contrary to sections 212‑214(5)‑218 of theCriminal Code.  At trial the accused admitted all the facts outlined above. On December 7, 1982 the accused was found guilty of first degree murder. The accused's appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed on April 2, 1985 (perL'Heureux‑Dubé, Beauregard and LeBel JJ.A.), the court substituting a verdict of second degree murder for the jury's verdict of first degree murder: J.E. 85‑556. Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown by this Court (perBeetz, Lamer and Wilson JJ.) on June 27, 1985, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xii. ",

        "Facts": " 3.In December, 1982, one Neil Whiteman became engaged in a plan to rob a Calgary supermarket. He obtained from an employee of the store, who later gave evidence for the Crown at his trial, information as to the layout and operation of the store, including the location of the safe, and the name and identity of the head cashier who had a key to the safe. The plan was that the head cashier would be kidnapped in the store's parking lot in the evening after store‑closing. She would then be forced to re‑enter the store and open the safe. On December 19, 1982, the head cashier on opening her car door saw a masked man hiding in the back seat of her car. She slammed the door shut and ran in one direction. The masked man ran in another direction and the store remained secure. No arrests were made.  4.In June, 1983, the police were investigating Whiteman and others, not including the appellants, concerning several property offences not connected with charges in the case at bar. For this purpose on June 29, 1983, they applied for and were granted by Waite J., of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, a judicial authorization, valid for 60 days, which empowered designated persons to intercept telecommunications and oral communications as set out in the authorization:  . . . and for such purpose to install, monitor, or remove any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device including where necessary, entering those places set out in Paragraphs 3 and 4 herein that may be required to implement this Authorization.  Paragraph 3 named four known persons whose communications could be intercepted and four addresses in Calgary where the interceptions could be made. Neither of the appellants was named in the authorization. Paragraphs 3 and 4 also authorized the police to intercept private communications of the four named individuals, as well as those of unknown persons:  . . . at any other place, stationary or mobile, in the Province of Alberta, that the known persons are using or attending or can be reasonably expected to use or attend.  The offences in respect of which the authorization permitted the interceptions were theft, conspiracy to commit theft, possession of stolen property, conspiracy to possess stolen property, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to break and enter.  5.The Crown's position was that as a result of its investigation and surveillance evidence had been revealed that Whiteman, the two appellants, and two other individuals had revived the plan to rob the supermarket by kidnapping the cashier and forcing her to open the safe. The Crown claimed that Whiteman and his girlfriend, the appellant Vanweenan, in pursuit of this scheme placed the head cashier under surveillance by following her in Whiteman's truck. While Whiteman and Vanweenan were following and observing the cashier, the police were following and observing Whiteman and Vanweenan. To further the investigation relating to the robbery of the supermarket, the police concluded that they might procure evidence by placing a listening device in Whiteman's truck. On July 7, 1983, acting under the authorization which had been granted earlier, the police were able to place surreptitiously a short‑range listening device in Whiteman's truck. It was wired to the truck's battery which provided power for its transmitter.  6.At trial, the technician who installed the device in the truck said that although the device drew power from the battery, it had no negative effect upon the battery because once the vehicle started it would recharge and restore any lost power. He acknowledged that in theory the device could drain all power from the battery, rendering it wholly inoperative, but this would occur only if it were left in the vehicle and the vehicle itself was not started for thirty consecutive days. It was not disputed that in this case the device caused no injury to vehicle or battery.  7.Surveillance was maintained until the end of July 1983 when the plan to rob the supermarket was again abandoned. The various parties to these events were arrested, including the two appellants who pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.  8.The intercepted private communications, which were tendered as evidence by the Crown, include (a) conversations between Vanweenan, who was not named in the authorization, and Neil Whiteman, who was named; (b) a conversation between Vanweenan and Ted Christianou, neither of whom was named in the authorization; (c) a conversation between Vanweenan, Chesson and Whiteman; and (d) conversations between Chesson and an unidentified person in the truck.

The information reads as follows:  I, Norm Maleng, Prosecuting Attorney for King County in the name and by the authority of the state of Washington, by this Information do accuse Melford Keith Johnson, of the crime of theft in the second degree, committed as follows:  That the defendant Melford Keith Johnson, in King County, Washington, on or about February 20, 1979, with intent to deprive another of property to wit: a Lowrey Organ, did exert unauthorized control over such property belonging to Mr. and Mrs. George Ford; that the value of such property did exceed $250:  Contrary to RCW 9A.56.040(1)(A).020(1)(a), and against the peace and dignity of the state of Washington.  The material facts underlying the charge are as follows. In February 1979 a Washington couple, the Fords, placed an advertisement in a Seattle newspaper offering to sell a \"Lowrey\" organ. The respondent Johnson offered to attempt to sell it for them. Johnson and the Fords entered into an agreement giving Johnson possession of the organ for thirty days after which he was to return the organ if it had not been sold. During the thirty‑day period Johnson referred two offers to the Fords; the Fords rejected the offers because they were too low.  10.At the expiry of the thirty‑day period the organ was not returned. The Fords attempted to locate Johnson and the organ but were unsuccessful on both counts.  11.Johnson was arrested in Seattle, Washington, on May 8, 1982. He pleaded guilty to the offence of theft in the second degree and was sentenced to the maximum term of five years' imprisonment. On December 26, 1982 Johnson escaped from prison. He left the State of Washington and came to Canada. At the time of his escape fifty‑two months of his sentence remained to be served.  12.Authorities in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have Johnson extradited pursuant to the terms of theCanada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty,1976. On September 7, 1983, an information was sworn before a Vancouver extradition judge stating that Johnson was a convicted fugitive who had escaped from custody in Washington. The judge issued a warrant for the apprehension of Johnson pursuant to s. 10(1) of theExtradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21. Johnson was arrested on September 13, 1983, and was released on bail pending the extradition hearing. After a number of delays the hearing was finally held on July 27, 1984, before Cowan Co. Ct. J. sitting as an extradition judge. ",

        "Facts": " 2.The appellant, Nelson Pierre Bernard, was charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm to the complainant contrary to s. 246.2(c) of theCriminal Code. That subsection provides that everyone who, in committing a sexual assault, causes bodily harm to the complainant is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.  3.The facts may be briefly stated.  4.The complainant, eighteen years of age at the relevant time, visited the appellant, twenty‑four years old. The appellant went out to dinner and to a bar with some friends while the complainant stayed behind in his apartment. Later that night the group returned to the flat. The friends departed, leaving the appellant and the complainant alone together.  5.The complainant testified that she had complied with the appellant's request to remain in the apartment after the friends' departure, both because she was not feeling well and because it was the first Christmas since the death of her father. She and the appellant, who had been a good friend of her late father, were going to talk about him.  6.The two lay down on the couch together and began talking. The complainant testified that she was then forced to have sexual intercourse without her consent and was subjected to serious bodily injury at the hands of the appellant. There was evidence that the appellant had punched the complainant twice with a closed fist, once above the eye, causing the eyelid to bleed profusely, and that he had threatened to kill her. There was evidence of a blood‑stained towel and pillow case concealed in the toilet tank of the appellant's apartment. Counsel for the appellant admitted that intercourse had taken place.  7.The complainant testified that the appellant had been drinking but was able to walk, to see everything, to talk clearly, and to put albums on the record player. One of the friends of the appellant testified that the appellant had been drinking on the night in question and, though he became rowdy, he was walking straight and talking.  8.When the police arrived at the appellant's apartment, he was awakened from a deep sleep and seemed to be suffering somewhat from his drinking. The appellant stated that his drunkenness caused the attack on the complainant.  9.The appellant was tried before a judge and jury. He did not testify at the trial, but the Crown led evidence of a statement he had made to the police. In the statement he admitted that he had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse with him. He stated that he did not know why he had done it because he was drunk and that, \"when I realized what I was doing, I got off.\" In charging the jury, the trial judge made no reference to the intent requirement, beyond reading the jury the definition of assault. The jury was told that the sole issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant had not consented to the intercourse because of the assault and threats made by the accused. With respect to drunkenness, the trial judge said as follows: \"Only the accused in his statement says, `I was all drunked up too.' There was no evidence of drunkenness except that statement and it is open to you to accept it and find that he was drunk but even if he was drunk, drunkenness is no defence to the charge alleged against this accused.\"  10.The appellant was convicted and sentenced to four years imprisonment. An appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario was dismissed (now reported at (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 574). Dubin J.A., delivering the oral judgment of the Court, said at p. 574:  On the merits, the Crown's case was overwhelming. The complainant's testimony that she was forced to have sexual intercourse without her consent and the serious bodily injury which she suffered during the course of the assault was confirmed in every respect by other evidence.  With respect, I agree.  11.Dubin J.A. concluded at p. 576:  Mr. Ruby also took objection to passages in the judge's charge. We are all satisfied that the charge, when read as a whole, is more favourable to the appellant than the evidence warranted. In any event, we are satisfied that even if objection could be taken to some of the expressions used by the trial judge, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in this case.  II ",

        "Facts": " (i)Introductory  4Having met as students at the University of Iowa, Colin Thatcher and his former wife JoAnn were married on August 12, 1962. After their marriage, they returned to Saskatchewan. They took up residence in Moose Jaw. Mr. Thatcher, the son of a one‑time member of Parliament and Premier of Saskatchewan, developed over the years an active and successful career as rancher, farmer and politician, serving for a time as Minister of Energy and Mines in a Progressive Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. Three children, Greg, Regan and Stephanie, were born of the marriage. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during the course of the marriage. The couple separated in August 1979. JoAnn, taking the two youngest children with her, left Moose Jaw with Mr. Thatcher's best friend, Ron Graham. Relations between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial property battles. Colin Thatcher became obsessed. At one juncture he spirited Regan out of the country, and was found in contempt and ordered to pay a substantial fine. JoAnn's matrimonial property entitlement was initially held to amount to $820,000 but the judgment was immediately appealed. In 1980, the Thatchers were divorced. In January 1981, JoAnn married Mr. Tony Wilson and moved into a house located across the street from the Legislative Buildings in Regina.  (ii)The Spring of 1981  5On the evening of Sunday, May 17, 1981 JoAnn Wilson was shot and wounded while in the kitchen of her home. A bullet fired from a high‑powered rifle passed through a triple glaze glass window and struck her in the shoulder. She was hospitalized for about three weeks. The evidence was that JoAnn Wilson was terrified by this attempt on her life. After the shooting, she gave up her right to custody of Regan and, a year later, agreed to accept approximately one half of the original court award, spread over five years. No one was charged with the May 17, 1981 incident.  (iii)January 21, 1983  6At about 6 o'clock in the evening of January 21, 1983, JoAnn Wilson came home, drove into the garage of her home and was ferociously beaten and then shot to death. Twenty‑seven wounds were inflicted on her head, neck, hands and lower legs. The injuries included a broken arm, a fracture of the wrist and a severed little left finger. A single bullet entered her skull causing death.  7Mr. Craig Dotson testified as to the finding of the body. He stated that he left work at the Legislative Buildings shortly before 6:00 p.m. on January 21, 1983, and was walking home when he noted a green car with a female driver turn into the garage at the Wilson residence. He continued walking for about a block. He heard loud shrill screams behind him. He turned back to investigate. He heard a single loud sharp noise and then silence. As he approached a lane near the Wilson garage he saw a man emerge from the garage. He did not pay any particular attention. It was dark. He was 30 to 40 feet from the individual. He walked a little further and saw a body in a pool of blood on the floor of the garage.  8Mr. Dotson told the police he thought the man he momentarily observed had a beard, was about thirty years old, five foot nine to five foot eleven in height, and of medium build. A composite sketch prepared by the police with Mr. Dotson's aid did not fit Colin Thatcher, whom Mr. Dotson knew as a member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly.  II ",

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. He testified at trial and, at the close of the case for the defence, brought an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis of entrapment. The application was refused and a conviction entered by Wetmore Co. Ct. J., sitting without a jury, in written reasons reported in (1983), 34 C.R. (3d) 228. A notice of appeal from that decision was filed with the British Columbia Court of Appeal but the appeal books were not filed within the time prescribed. Counsel for the appellant sought and obtained, with the consent of Crown Counsel, an order dispensing with the requirement that transcripts of evidence be filed and permitting counsel to base their arguments solely on the reasons for judgment of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. The Chief Justice of British Columbia directed that a panel of five judges hear the appeal. For the reasons given by Craig J.A., on behalf of the Court, the appeal was dismissed. This decision is now reported at (1985), 49 C.R. (3d) 169. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court.  It is necessary to describe in some detail the relevant facts. In view of the particular procedural history of this appeal, I think it is appropriate to reproduce in its entirety the summary of the evidence provided for in the reasons for judgment of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. (at pp. 234‑37):  Through information obtained from an officer of the Ontario Provincial Police, one Momotiuk was brought to British Columbia. This man had apparently been dealing in narcotics in Kenora, Ontario. He was placed under police \"handlers\" in Vancouver, he visited the accused on a number of occasions, and eventually a transaction was set up whereby the accused would deliver cocaine to Momotiuk.  The accused testified. He first met Momotiuk in 1979 in Montreal where the accused was visiting one Franks. The accused understood Franks and Momotiuk to be associated in some clothing franchise.  The accused at this time was attempting to develop some property for sale near De Roche, British Columbia, and told Franks and Momotiuk of this and both expressed some interest in buying. Both arrived in British Columbia in October 1979. In the course of this visit the accused says that Momotiuk told him he was a drug trafficker in Kenora and wanted some \"Thai pot\". The accused says he had no interest.  Momotiuk, according to the accused, called later still wanting to make drug deals, and the accused told him he was interested only in real estate deals.  The accused again went to a yoga retreat near Montreal in December 1979. Franks and Momotiuk visited him there. Momotiuk produced some cocaine, which he and Franks used, and again asked the accused to become a supplier. A few days later they met again. At this time conversation was directed to show Momotiuk as an importer of drugs on a large scale, and again the accused was invited to join in and refused.  In January and February there were approximately seven telephone calls from Momotiuk to the accused soliciting his involvement. The accused says he refused.  In mid‑February 1980 Momotiuk visited the accused again, asking him to supply drugs. The accused says he told Momotiuk he was not interested and asked to be left alone. Momotiuk continued to visit two or three times and also telephoned.  In March the accused says Momotiuk arrived again. They went for a walk in the woods. Momotiuk produced a pistol and was going to show the accused his marksmanship. He was dissuaded because of the probability of startling the horses nearby. The accused says that at this remote area Momotiuk said, \"A person could get lost.\" This the accused says was a threat. He says the matter of drugs was again raised and the accused says he was adamant that he had no knowledge of drugs sources.  The accused was asked to phone him twice and did not. One Matheson attended at the accused's residence on 13th March with a message that Momotiuk was very excited and wanted to see him at the Biltmore Hotel. The accused says he wanted nothing to do with Momo­tiuk but was terrified of him and agreed to go into town to the Biltmore. He also says that Matheson told him Momotiuk had some friends with him. This the accused took to be other members of this illegal syndicate.  While en route to the city he twice noted a car which seemed to be following him. This was probably so, because undercover police officers were doing a surveillance at the time.  On arrival at the hotel he met Momotiuk. Again he was informed of the syndicate. He was asked then if he wished to see the buying power. The accused agreed. He was directed to a car outside the hotel. In this car was an open briefcase with $50,000 exposed. The custodian, unknown to the accused, was an undercover policeman.  The accused returned to the hotel, Momotiuk asked him to get a sample and gave him $50 for this purpose.  The accused left and went to a supplier he had known of from years back. This supplier, one Goldsmith, now dead, heard the accused's story and agreed to supply \"in order to get Doug (Momotiuk) off me\". He obtained the sample and delivered it to Momotiuk, who tested it and said to get as much as he could. He returned to the supplier and offered $35,000 to $40,000 for a pound.  At the meeting the following day the accused had still not acquired the drugs and he says that at this point he was told to get his act together, in a threatening way.  I need not detail the accused's evidence of the following two days. He obtained 12 ounces of cocaine, and was to pay $27,000 for it. This credit, he says, was extended to him by Goldsmith on the basis of payment when delivered to Momotiuk. It was in the course of this delivery that he was arrested.  It is on the basis of this testimony that the accused says he was entrapped. Momotiuk, Matheson and Franks did not testify. Neither did \"Bonnie\", the accused's former wife, who was apparently present at one of the Montreal meetings, where cocaine was produced and some discussion took place.  The accused has drug convictions in 1972 and 1976, two in 1978 and one in 1979. Those in 1976, one in 1978 and one in 1979 involved cocaine. He says his former use of drugs arose to relieve back pain, but in 1978 he discovered relief from yoga and gave up the use of narcotics. The offence in 1979 was a fall from grace when he met up with old friends. ",

            "17.                     Catliff Co. Ct. J. noted that the appellant had plenty of chances to avoid committing the offence. He refused to give credit to the appellant's argument that he did it because of an obligation to a friend. Catliff Co. Ct. J. characterized this as a submission which \"amounts almost to saying he was entrapped by friendship\". The appellant was not, in the words of Ritchie J. in Amato v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at p. 473, the subject of \"police tactics [which] are such as to leave no room for the formation of independent criminal intent\".",
            "24.                     The offence of drug trafficking is, as was noted in Mack, supra, one which is especially difficult to detect and the use of undercover agents and informers ‑‑ like Kirkus in the present case ‑‑ is common and necessary. There has been no exploitation of a close personal relationship between Kirkus and the appellant. If the police were unable to rely on the existing connections and associations between people in the narcotics business they would be unduly hampered in their efforts at detecting crime and preventing further criminal activity. Certainly there was an appeal to the appellant because of his friendship with Kirkus but it was not unduly exploitive and nor was the dignity of their relationship violated. This alone is not sufficient to establish the defence in the absence of any other factors."
        ],
        "Facts": " 3.The Crown called two witnesses on thevoir dire, Constable Hickman and Constable Adam, and the appellant testified on his own behalf. Constable Hickman testified that Ward Kirkus, the alleged entrapper, was facing a potential narcotics charge and it was agreed that the police would give him some consideration with respect to his charge in exchange for Kirkus' assisting the police. Constable Hickman had information, received from Kirkus and others, that the appellant was a supplier of narcotics. Constable Hickman instructed Kirkus to phone the appellant for the purpose of arranging a sale of narcotics. Following a discussion with Kirkus, Constable Hickman directed an undercover officer, Constable Adam, to go to a mall parking lot on March 15, 1982, approach a person sitting in a specific vehicle, and ask if he could purchase some drugs. Adam was provided with approximately $200 to that end. The person in the car was in fact Kirkus. Constable Hickman had told Kirkus that a man would approach him in his car. Neither Constable Adam nor Kirkus were informed of the fact they were both working for the police, in accordance with standard police procedure. It is clear, however, that Constable Adam suspected Kirkus was acting on behalf of the police upon meeting him at the mall. At all material times Constable Hickman was assisting in the surveillance of this undercover investigation of the appellant.  4.There were three narcotics transactions arising from the association set up by Kirkus between the appellant and the undercover Constable Adam, only the second of which the appellant was charged.  5.On March 15, 1982, Constable Adam met Kirkus and Kirkus drove him to the appellant's house. Kirkus introduced Constable Adam to the appellant. Constable Adam testified that Kirkus asked the appellant if he had any narcotics and the appellant, who had been told by Kirkus that a half‑pound of marijuana would be purchased, stated that he was \"doing pounds for $1,900.\" Constable Adam testified that he told the appellant he could not afford to buy a half‑pound at that time and it was arranged that the appellant and the officer meet again on March 18. At some point during the discussion Constable Adam picked up a plastic bag containing approximately half an ounce of marijuana. Constable Adam inquired as to the amount and price and the appellant sold this package to Constable Adam at that time. The appellant was not charged with any offence as a result of this transaction.  6.As arranged, the appellant met with Constable Adam on March 18 and while driving in his car the appellant pulled out a bag containing three individually packaged half‑pounds of marijuana. The two men discussed prices and Adam had the appellant stop so that Adam could obtain an additional $100 needed to buy one of the half‑pounds. At this time the appellant, upon being asked by Constable Adam, indicated that he could supply cocaine, \"red hair\" (marijuana) and he stated that he had been dealing for years and was lucky to find some really good sources. The agreed to transaction was then completed.  7.Constable Adam testified that he phoned the appellant on April 13, and the appellant phoned him the next day, and the two met on the 15th. Constable Adam gave evidence that a further drug transaction was set up and the appellant took him to the residence of a Scott Muirhead. The appellant introduced them and then left. A transaction involving five pounds of marijuana was concluded between Muirhead and the undercover officer. The appellant was not charged with respect to this sale although Muirhead was.  8.The appellant testified that he and Wade Kirkus were friends and they had known each other for approximately seven years. He had not heard from him for about six months when he received a phone call on March 6, 1982. Kirkus told him he had a friend who was interested in buying marijuana and who was willing to pay a \"lot of money\". The appellant says he told Kirkus he was not really interested and, while he may know someone, he was not willing to get involved.  9.The next day Kirkus called and repeated his request. The appellant again said he was not interested and he asked Kirkus how much money was involved. Kirkus told him that his friend was willing to buy ten to fifteen pounds. The appellant says he told Kirkus \"you are talking to the wrong guy\". Kirkus then asked for about a half‑pound. The appellant agreed to ask around for him and told Kirkus to phone him back.  10.The appellant asked a friend but that person did not want to deal with Kirkus. When Kirkus phoned back, he said he was unable to assist him. Then Kirkus asked if the appellant could please help him out \"just this once\". The appellant then asked about Kirkus' friend and Kirkus again stressed the profit they would both make and the appellant said he would have to think about it. Similar conversations initiated by Kirkus occurred the next two nights and Kirkus emphasized that his friend might be getting impatient. The appellant suggested that he meet Kirkus' friend and if he thought he was \"okay\" he would try and arrange a meeting between his friend and the undercover officer.  11.The next day Kirkus phoned twice to see whether the appellant had made the arrangements and the appellant said he was too busy and unable to reach his friend and he agreed to check the next day. That following day Kirkus phoned and the appellant said he still had not reached his friend. Kirkus asked how long it would take and the appellant told him to call back in an hour. When Kirkus called, the appellant told him he could bring the officer to the appellant's home on Monday, March 15. Kirkus said his friend, Constable Adam, had approximately $1,000 to spend.  12.The appellant gave evidence that he had never sold marijuana to anyone before and he made the following statement when asked what was going on in his mind as the phone calls from Kirkus continued:   ...A:   He was calling me every day. He would talk to me, and I told him I didn't think so, and I didn't know, and I would check it, and I started telling him I would call him back, and I never did. I never checked it, and finally it just got to be a bit of a problem, him calling me every day.  Q:      Why weren't you checking it?  ...A:   Because I wasn't interested in doing it.  Q:      And what did you think would happen?  ...A:   I thought he would maybe find someone else to deal with and he might stop calling me. I was hoping that he would work it out himself.  13.Then the appellant contacted Scott Muirhead who supplied him with three separately wrapped half‑pounds of marijuana. The appellant did not pay for them but arranged to share the proceeds with Muirhead with the appellant earning $250 on the sale of one half‑pound. The appellant explained why he had two extra half‑pounds in the following manner:  Well, Scott gave me more than one‑half pound, and I asked him why he was giving me more, and he told me, well, maybe the guy will like it and take more. It would just be more money for you, you are doing it now, so, you know, a few more dollars for you would be even better. I just‑‑I didn't say‑‑I couldn't say no. He just asked if there was a problem and I told him, no, I guess not.  14.The appellant was asked why he sold the half‑pound on the 18th, following the first meeting with Constable Adam. He stated:  Well, there is a various number of reasons. It was a combination of reasons, I guess. Ward [Kirkus] was a very good friend of mine at the time. He was persistently calling me, and the money was a factor. I just couldn't say no to a friend, who really wanted me to help him out. He sounded, not desperate, but almost desperate to the point where, you know, you've got to help me out just this once. So, his persistence, or his constant calling didn't stop, so I really didn't have the will to say no to a friend. So, I did it just the once.  15.The appellant insisted that the reason why he acted as if he knew about drugs and sources in his interactions with Constable Adam was because Muirhead told him to \"talk big\" and to appear like a drug dealer so as to impress the Constable and that he just did what Muirhead told him to do. In cross‑examination, the following exchange took place which provides a useful summary of the appellant's position:    Q:      So, to sum up, you really got talked into this, is that what you are saying, by Kirkus and Muirhead?  ...A:   Well, I was beginning‑‑it was beginning to be a problem with them calling me all the time, you know. He was a friend. He sounded like he needed help, and it was a one‑shot deal, so I did it for a friend, a good friend.  Q:      But you got $250 out of it?  ...A:   I did get some money for it, yes. That wasn't the main reason, though. ",

        "Facts": " 5.On September 9, 1983, Constable Bisceglia was the officer in charge of the Drug Section of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) Detachment in Campbell River, British Columbia. That day, a confidential source told him that the appellant had a quantity of marijuana at his apartment. Two other sources had given Constable Bisceglia the same tip within the previous few days. Early in the afternoon, Constable Bisceglia appeared before a justice of the peace and applied under s. 10 of theNarcotic Control Actfor a warrant to search a dwelling for narcotics. The justice of the peace issued the search warrant. In compliance with s. 10(2) of the Act, the warrant named Constables Bisceglia, Arseneault, Clark, and Underhill, all of the R.C.M.P., as the peace officers authorized to enter and search the dwelling. The warrant was valid between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. of that day.  6.The officers went to the appellant's apartment at 4:00 p.m. but no‑one was home. They did not attempt to enter but went about other duties. At approximately 6:00 p.m., Constable Arseneault learned that the appellant was at home, but was leaving shortly for Vancouver, and would not be back for two or three days. Constable Bisceglia decided to execute the warrant immediately, but Constables Clark and Underhill were about to go off duty. Constable Bisceglia telephoned the justice of the peace who had issued the search warrant, explained the circumstances, and asked if it would be possible to substitute two other officers. The justice of the peace authorized the substitution and the officers went to the appellant's apartment, arriving there around 6:20 p.m. All four were dressed in civilian clothes.  7.The police officers knocked on the door. The appellant answered. Two other men were in the apartment, in the living room. Constable Bisceglia gave the appellant a copy of the search warrant, showed his identification, and arrested the appellant for possession of marijuana. He then read the standard police warning, including the right to counsel guaranteed by theCharter. The appellant immediately picked up the phone and said he was going to call his lawyer, but Constable Bisceglia told him that he could not telephone until the police had \"matters under control.\" Constable Bisceglia then asked the appellant for his full name, address and age, and for some identification. He also asked the appellant some questions concerning his marijuana usage. Constable Bisceglia then asked the other two men for their names. Approximately forty minutes after the police entered the apartment, the two men left. While Constable Bisceglia interviewed the appellant and the two men, the other officers searched the apartment. After the two men left, Constable Bisceglia assisted in the search. Constable Vanschaik and Corpo­ral McBratney, the two substituted officers, did not seize items they discovered in the search, but pointed them out to Constables Bisceglia and Arseneault to seize. Constables Bisceglia and Arseneault together seized about 300 grams of \"green plant‑like material,\" a set of scales, plastic bags, a \"hook up\" [sic] pipe, and a \"huge number\" of bills totalling $3,193. After the conclusion of the search, the police took the accused to the police station, arriving there around 8:00 p.m. He was then allowed to telephone his lawyer.  8.At thevoir direon the admission of the evidence, Constable Bisceglia was asked to explain what he had meant when he told the appellant that he could not telephone his lawyer until the officers had matters under control. Constable Bisceglia explained that he wanted to find out who were the two additional occupants of the apartment. He was also aware that the appellant had two restricted firearms at the apartment, for which the appellant had the appropriate registration certificates. Constable Bisceglia explained that he wanted to locate the two revolvers.  9.After his initial attempt to contact counsel, the appellant made no further request to use the telephone. The police officers did not advise him again of his right to retain counsel after the initial warnings.  III ",

        "Facts": " In October of 1983, Owen Swain was arrested and charged with assault and aggravated assault, contrary toss. 245and 245.2(2) of theCriminal Code(nowR.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, ss. 266and268).  These charges arose from an incident in which the appellant, Mr. Swain, attacked his wife and two infant children in a bizarre manner.  Fortunately, Mrs. Swain and the children sustained only superficial physical injuries.  At trial, the appellant's wife testified that during the incident Swain appeared to be fighting with the air and talking about spirits.  At the time of his arrest, the appellant was very excited and spoke in a \"dialect\" about religious themes.  Mr. Swain testified at trial that, during the incident, he felt his family was being attacked by devils and that he had to protect them by carrying out certain acts.  On November 1, 1983, the appellant was transferred from the Toronto Jail to the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre pursuant to a Form 1 application under theMental Health Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 262.   While at the Centre, Swain behaved in a bizarre and regressive manner.  Two anti-psychotic drugs were prescribed and administered to him and his condition improved rapidly.  By December 19, 1983, the appellant was released into the community (on the condition that he would continue to see a psychiatrist) on the recommendation of Dr. Fleming, the Director of the forensic unit at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre.  Mr. Swain returned briefly to jail and was granted bail on conditions shortly thereafter.  The appellant remained on bail until June 10, 1985, and continued to take medication and to see a psychiatrist.  On May 3, 1985, Mr. Swain's trial took place in the District Court of Ontario before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.  At trial, the Crown sought to adduce evidence with respect to insanity at the time of the offence, to which the appellant objected.  After conducting avoir dire, the trial judge ruled that the Crown could adduce such evidence.  At the conclusion of the trial, Mr. Swain was found not guilty by reason of insanity on all counts.  Defence counsel then moved to have s. 542(2) of theCode(now s. 614), which provides for the automatic detention at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor of an insanity acquittee, declared inoperative on the basis that it violated theCharter. O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. reserved judgment and on June 10, 1985, held that Mr. Swain's constitutional rights were not infringed by s. 542(2) and ordered that the appellant be kept in strict custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto until the Lieutenant Governor's pleasure was known.  Mr. Swain filed a notice of appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal and applied for bail pending appeal.  Martin J.A., in Chambers, adjourned this application in order to permit an early hearing of the appellant's case by the Advisory Review Board (the body which may be appointed to advise the Lieutenant Governor concerning the detention of insanity acquittees).  On June 12, 1985, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant further detaining the appellant in safe custody in a mental hospital for assessment and report to the Advisory Review Board within 30 days.  Neither the appellant nor his counsel received prior notice of this decision, although it would appear that some attempts were made to notify the appellant's counsel.  Accordingly, neither the appellant nor his counsel made submissions with respect to this decision.  Pursuant to the above-mentioned warrant, Mr. Swain was sent for psychiatric examination and assessment to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, where he remained a patient in the forensic unit until July 12, 1985.  The Advisory Review Board held a review hearing on July 26, 1985, pursuant to the provisions of s. 547 of theCode(now s. 619).  The appellant and his counsel were present at this hearing.  On August 6, 1985, the Advisory Review Board recommended to the Lieutenant Governor that Mr. Swain should remain in safe custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre.  Shortly thereafter, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant for the further detention of Mr. Swain.  The Lieutenant Governor accepted the recommendations of the Board which provided,inter alia, that the administrator of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre have the discretion to permit the appellant to re-enter the community with conditions as to supervision and follow-up treatment.  On two occasions (July 30, 1985 and August 20, 1985), the appellant's counsel wrote to the Lieutenant Governor requesting the right to appear and make submissions before the Lieutenant Governor at the time when the recommendation of the Advisory Review Board would be considered.  This request was not granted.  It was not until after the Lieutenant Governor's warrant for the further detention of Mr. Swain had issued that the recommendation of the Advisory Review Board was released to the appellant's counsel.  The appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was heard in early September, 1985.  A majority of the Court of Appeal (perThorson J.A.) dismissed the appeal, Brooke J.A. dissenting.  The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, which application was granted on March 26, 1987.  At the time that the application for leave to appeal was filed, the appellant was in safe custody.  However, on September 4, 1986, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario ordered that his warrant detaining the appellant be vacated and that the appellant be discharged absolutely.

        "Facts": " 1.In February 1983 the appellant, while riding in the rear seat of a car, killed 18‑year‑old Cindy Thompson and 4‑year‑old Stewart Hawley, who were passengers in the front seat, by shooting them in the head. He also wounded two other people. He was indicted on two counts of second degree murder, and at the trial raised the defences of insanity and, alternatively, intoxication.  2.The evidence led at trial revealed that the appellant was a member of a motorcycle club, a drug pusher, and highly suspicious of members of rival clubs. During the week of the shooting he had taken a great deal of cocaine and slept little. Defence psychiatrists testified that Mailloux's paranoid personality became aggravated by the cocaine and the result was a very rare condition, toxic psychosis. The psychiatrists said that this was a major mental illness which caused a break with reality and led to the appellant believing that he was acting in self‑defence. However, on the crucial issue of whether the appellant was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that they were wrong, the psychiatric evidence was conflicting. On examination in chief both psychiatrists said that he was not capable; under cross‑examination they said that he was. The jury found the appellant guilty of second degree murder on both counts.  3.Mailloux's appeal was argued on a number of grounds relating to the trial judge's direction to the jury on \"disease of the mind\", on whether the accused met the requirements ofs. 16(2)of theCriminal Code, and on intoxication. All of these grounds were rejected by the Court of Appeal and are not at issue before this Court, as the appellant was granted leave to appeal only on the correct interpretation to be placed on s. 613(1)(d) of theCode.

        "Facts": " 2.The complainant was nineteen years old and had completed her high school education in a small Ontario town. Some three months before the incident she had moved to Toronto. She was living with a girlfriend, Eileen, also nineteen years old, in a flat in a house. The complainant usually worked a day shift from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m as a waitress in a restaurant. The roommate worked the night shift from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. at a nearby convenience store.  3.In late November, 1983, the roommate met the accused, whose first name is Jim, when she served him as a customer at the convenience store. On a subsequent night the accused spent six hours at the convenience store conversing with the roommate. During their conversation the roommate spoke about the complainant and mentioned that they rarely saw each other because of their different work shifts.  4.On December 3, 1983, a man who gave his name as Jim telephoned the apartment where the two young women lived. (At the time of his arrest on December 8, 1983, the accused had a book with the phone number written in it.) The complainant answered the phone. The man asked for the roommate but was told that she was at work. The caller asked if he could come over anyway. The complainant did not know the telephone caller and said no. She told the caller that her boyfriend Doug was coming over shortly. The man said, \"If I can't have you, I'll go and get Eileen.\"  5.On a subsequent occasion the accused, uninvited, met the roommate as she was warming up her car after getting off work in the morning. He indicated that he wanted to talk. After some discussion they decided to go back to the roommate's apartment. The complainant was not at home. In the living‑room the accused saw pictures of the complainant and indicated that he would be interested in meeting her. The accused and the roommate had a lengthy conversation. The accused asked the roommate if he could sleep with her. She refused. He briefly put his arms around her. She asked him repeatedly to leave. He refused. She left the apartment and went out onto the front porch. After a few minutes he came out. The accused decided to take the bus home. The roommate was walking with the accused towards the bus stop when be pinned her up against a wall and stated that he could never love her, he could only hurt her. He told her to take him home by car which she did.  6.On December 6, 1983, the accused telephoned the roommate Eileen at the apartment. She told the accused that both she and the complainant were going to work that night. The roommate left for work at 10:30 p.m. The complainant worked from 5:00 p.m. until 12:00 p.m. This was not her usual shift. The complainant returned home from work at 12:30 a.m. and went to sleep in her bedroom.  7.The complainant testified that at about 4:30 a.m. she was awakened by knocking at the apartment door. She was not expecting anybody. She got up. She was wearing a blue night‑gown and underpants. She went to the front door. This door, which opened into the living‑room, was locked.  8.The complainant asked who was there and the accused replied that it was Bruce. He said that he was a friend of Eileen's and that he had something for her from Eileen. (Eileen had not seen the accused that night, nor had she sent him over.) The complainant asked repeatedly what he had but he would not say. He said the complainant should let him in and he would give it to her. The complainant tried three or four times to telephone Eileen at work to find out if she had sent somebody over. The line was always busy. (Eileen was involved in a lengthy conversation with her boyfriend.) The complainant thought her roommate could be playing a joke on her although she had never done anything like that before. She unlocked and opened the door. The accused entered the living‑room. The complainant had never seen him before. He appeared to have been drinking. She asked the accused who he was and what he had for her but got no response. She asked \"Who are you, Bruce?\" The accused replied \"Bruce, the bad guy.\" The accused did not interfere when the complainant attempted, again unsuccessfully, to telephone her roommate. The accused used the telephone himself. While the complainant could not recall the substance of the accused's telephone conversation she had the impression he was talking to his brother. He said something about meeting his lawyer the next morning. At the end he said \"Tell your wife I love her.\"  9.The complainant went to the door and told the accused to leave. Instead of making any move to leave he asked if he could sleep with her. At this point the complainant became afraid. She told the accused that if he did not leave she was going to scream whereupon the accused put one hand over her mouth and with the other hand took hold of her hair and pulled her away from the door. He put her on her back on the floor and lay down on top of her. The complainant tried to push the accused off. He told her the more she fought the harder it was going to be for Eileen to find her, that she would never look the same again. The complainant was terrified and lay still.  10.The accused sat on the victim's chest with his knees spread across her arms so that she could not move. She begged him not to go on with what he was doing and to leave her alone. The accused reached behind himself and pushed the com­plain­ant's underpants down, ripping them in the process. He put his finger into her vagina. The complainant was crying. She felt helpless. In cross‑examination she testified that perhaps she should have struggled harder but she was frightened, shaking and confused. She was afraid that if she struggled the accused would hurt her.  11.The accused lay down on the victim and tried to kiss her. She attempted to turn away but he held the back of her head by the hair so that she could not move. She tried to bite his lips. The accused tore her night‑dress and pushed it off her. He then began to take his clothes off. The complainant pleaded with him not to do it. The complainant was going to scream. The accused stuffed a piece of clothing in her mouth to stifle the scream. The accused struck her with his hand across the eyebrow. He told her that if she tried to scream, he was going to see to it that she never talked again. She lay motionless while the accused finished undressing himself.  12.The accused straddled the victim's chest and put his penis in her mouth. His penis was not in her mouth very long and he did not ejaculate. He lay down on top of her again. The complainant had crossed her legs. The accused shoved his knee between her legs forcing them apart. He put his penis into her vagina. The complainant could not be sure whether the accused ejaculated during intercourse or not (subsequent forensic testing uncovered no semen or sperm in swabs taken from the victim). The accused stopped after a while and got dressed. As he was getting dressed, he turned to the complainant and said \"You're just like her. You're just like all the rest.\" The complainant asked him what he meant by that. He said \"You're my sixth.\" He brought the complainant with him to the kitchen. He had a glass of water and drank from a coke bottle.  13.The complainant told the accused that her roommate would be home soon. The accused told the complainant to phone the roommate at work and ask what time she was coming home from work. The accused was standing behind the complainant with his hand on her neck during the phone call. The complainant asked her roommate when she would be home. The roommate said she would be home at the usual time. The roommate testified that the complainant sounded anxious.  14.The accused persisted in asking the complainant if he could return the next night and she finally agreed in order to get him out of the apartment. The accused asked where Eileen or Doug would be if he came. The reference to Doug, whom the complainant had not referred to at any time during the incident, made the complainant remember the call of December 3, 1983 from the man who had identified himself as Jim. She asked the accused if he was Jim but he said nothing. The accused left at 5:15 or 5:30 a.m. After dressing the com­plain­ant telephoned her roommate once again. The roommate testified that the complainant sounded frightened.  15.The complainant went to her room and curled up on her bed. When the roommate got home at 6:45 a.m. she found the complainant terribly upset. She noticed a bruise on the complainant's eye. When the police constable arrived at 8:16 a.m. he also noted that the complainant seemed upset and a little incoherent. The complainant gave the policeman her torn nightgown and underwear. She showed him the coke bottle, glass and telephone (for the purpose of fingerprinting).  16.Doctor Lloyd Gordon examined the complainant at the emergency department of the Wellesley Hospital on December 7, 1983 at 11:15 a.m. He found a red mark over her left eyebrow. It was a mild abrasion such as might be caused by a moderate slap. The complainant also spoke of tenderness in the tailbone. Doctor Gordon noted, upon a vaginal examination of the complainant, that her cervix was slightly red. This was consistent with forced sexual intercourse. In cross‑examination he testified that it was also consistent with energetic sexual intercourse. ",

The break‑ins occurred on June 1, June 6‑8 and July 11, 1982.  16.On August 27, 1982 Barry Kowlyk, the accused's brother, was arrested in the act of committing a theft. During questioning by the investigating officers Barry Kowlyk admitted that he committed the three break and enters in question. He then led the officers to a house that he shared with the accused. Here the officers found seventy‑six items stolen during the break and enters described above. On entering the house with the police Barry Kowlyk yelled out \"Wake up Ray. The police are here. They got us. It's all over\".  17.The accused was found in his bedroom. The door was closed and the police officer demanded that the accused come out. The accused stated that he would do so after he got dressed. Five minutes later the accused emerged from his bedroom. A police officer who had been stationed outside testified that the accused had opened the curtains, unlocked the window and attempted to lift the window, but upon seeing the officer had stopped these activities. Fourteen of the stolen items were found in the accused's bedroom. The items were grouped according to the separate break‑ins.  18.The accused was arrested and charged with three counts of break, enter and theft. When questioned by the police about his involvement in the burglaries the accused replied \"All you got me for is possession. I'm not saying anything\". He made no further comment and did not testify at his trial. He was convicted of all three counts of break, enter and theft by Kroft J. in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench and was sentenced to thirty months' incarceration on each count to be served concurrently. These convictions were upheld by the Manitoba Court of Appeal (Philp J.A. dissenting): see (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 122. ",

        "Facts": " Hayes was convicted of first degree murder in March 1984 before Burchell J. of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and a jury.  The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for twenty-five years.  The circumstances giving rise to this charge and conviction concern the murder of Edmund Foster.  On the evening of October 5, 1983, the deceased, Foster, agreed to drive the appellant and Elmer King to a bootlegger.  After the three drove outside the town of Glace Bay, a knife was held to Foster and he was robbed of his wallet.  King then drove the car off the main highway to a rather deserted location where Foster was repeatedly stabbed with a knife.  Foster died at the scene as a result of these wounds.  The appellant and King then drove the deceased's car back into Glace Bay where it was set on fire.  Both the appellant and King were subsequently arrested and charged with first degree murder relating to the death of Foster.  At Hayes' trial, King testified that the robbery and murder were both carried out by Hayes.  In turn, Hayes took the stand and claimed that it was King who robbed and fatally stabbed Foster.  The dispute primarily concerned the respective roles of Hayes and King.  Following the conviction of the appellant, King was tried for murder relating to the same incident.  The jury returned a verdict of guilt on second degree murder.  King was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for twenty years.  The appellant launched an appeal of his conviction before the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (R. v. Hayes(1985), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 234).  However, when the transcripts of the trial were received prior to the appeal hearing, it was evident that there were gaps in the transcription of the proceedings.  Apparently the gaps resulted from a malfunction of the transcribing equipment.

        "Facts": " The appellants were charged with conspiracy to import marijuana between March 1, 1983 and September 12, 1983.  The Crown's case consisted principally of one hundred thirty-six intercepted communications.  At trial, avoir direwas held to determine the admissibility of the interceptions.  At its conclusion, the trial judge held all but nine inadmissible.  The Crown called no evidence before the jury and the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the appellants.  The Crown's appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered: (1986), 33 D.L.R. (4th) 744, [1986] 5 W.W.R. 131, 29 C.C.C. (3d) 516, 53 C.R. (3d) 56.  This appeal is made as of right under s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code.  The case involved an intensive police investigation which was carried out in widely separated areas of the province of British Columbia, and resulted on September 11, 1983 in a seizure of 278 lbs. of marijuana in a vehicle driven by the appellant, McDonald, in which Rosen was a passenger.  The police were aware from the outset that those under investigation resorted to and made wide use of pay telephones as a means of communication, and that in doing so they used a code to advise each other of the locations at which they could be reached.  During the investigation, the police installed and operated interception devices upon several pay telephones, private residential premises and hotel rooms occupied by the appellants or some of them.  Three authorizations were procured by the authorities during the investigation.  The authorizations are identical except for the dates, the agent applying for the authorization, the names of the affiants, and the identities of the persons whose private communications may be intercepted (targets) in paragraph (c) in each authorization.  The first authorization ran from March 23, 1983 to May 21, 1983.  It included appellants Thompson, Rosen and Auld. It permitted interception of telephone communications at the addresses of the appellants \"or elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia resorted to by the said Perry Gordon THOMPSON, Beebe AULD, Ross Allen ROSEN . . . \".  The affidavit filed before the authorizing judge revealed that the police authorities intended to intercept communications at public pay telephones.  Acting under this authorization, intercepting equipment was installed at several residences and hotel rooms and six public pay telephones.  For ease of reference, paragraphs (c) and (d) of the first authorization are reproduced below.  (c)The identities of the known persons whose private communications may be intercepted and the places at which private communications may be intercepted are:  Perry Gordon THOMPSON 171-1st Avenue Cultis Lake, B.C.                  (tel. no. 858-9276)  Beebe AULD 171-1st Avenue Cultis Lake, B.C.                  (tel. no. 858-9276)  Ross Allen ROSEN 3968 A Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-6254)  Miron Renoldo KRULL 1601 - Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-9992)  Lori Christine MARSHALL 1601 - Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-9992)  or elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia resorted to by the said Perry Gordon THOMPSON, Beebe AULD, Ross Allen ROSEN, Miron Renoldo KRULL and Lori Christine MARSHALL.  (d)The persons whose identities are not known as of the date hereof whose private communications may be intercepted and the places at which private communications may be intercepted are:  (i)those persons who resort to or use the premises described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof, or  (ii)those persons who are in communication with the persons described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof apparently with respect to an offence mentioned in paragraph (a) hereof;  which private communications may be intercepted at any of the premises hereinbefore described and any place or premises in the Province of British Columbia resorted to or used by the persons described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof.  On May 19, 1983 a second authorization was granted.  It ran from May 19, 1983 to July 17, 1983, overlapping the first authorization by two days.  It named ten persons, including all appellants except McDonald.  A third authorization was granted on July 15, 1983, again overlapping its predecessor.  It named twelve persons, including all appellants except McDonald.  The equipment installed during the first authorization remained in place in most of the pay telephones until the end of the investigation.  This interception capability was not mentioned in the second authorization.  During the second authorization interception equipment was installed with respect to an additional five pay telephones.  These eleven pay telephones were not mentioned in the third authorization.  Before the conclusion of the investigation, interception equipment was installed in nine more pay telephones, making a total of twenty.  Likewise there was no mention in the second and third authorizations of a listening device having been installed during the currency of the first authorization at the business premises of 1721 Harvey Avenue, Kelowna, British Columbia.  On approximately twenty occasions tape recorders were left on \"automatic play mode\" overnight with respect to certain pay phones.  This resulted in interception of conversations of persons not covered by the authorizations.  This is apparently contrary to R.C.M.P. policy with respect to monitoring pay telephones.  On such occasions the procedure was to rewind the tape, and play enough of the intercepted conversation to determine if a \"target\" was speaking.  Only if a target was speaking would the whole conversation be listened to and noted.  Otherwise, the conversation would be played forward at a fast speed and a low volume so that it was unintelligible.  If, however, no targets were speaking but early in the conversation it became apparent that the conversation related to other criminal activity, the entire conversation would be listened to.

            "The petition was entitled \"In the Matter of Section 178.13(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada \" and it referred specifically to the authorization granted on the 10th day of September A.D. 1980.   It was heard by Meredith J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and on July 17, 1985 it was dismissed.   On the hearing, the appellant did not apply to open the packet concerning the renewal and no request was made to open it.   In dismissing the petition, Meredith J. said:",
            "Dealing with the first ground, it was argued that the adoption by this Court in Wilson v. The Queen, supra, of a procedure derived from civil practice for the making of an application for a review of an authorization had the effect of severing the motion from the criminal process and making it civil in nature.  Its validity as a proceeding would not, therefore, rest solely upon the provisions of the Criminal Code  and the constitutional authority of s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 .   Rather, it would be supportable as a civil proceeding constitutionally based on s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . The admitted fact that no such appeal is authorized in the Criminal Code  would not bar the proceeding for the reason that avenues of appeal are provided in civil matters by provincial legislation.    It was argued that the Court of Appeal was in error in following its earlier judgment in Re Turangan and Chui and The Queen (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 249, and the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Cass (1985), 71 A.R. 248 (Alta. C.A.)   Both of these cases considered the matters before them as criminal in nature.   Therefore, the Court of Appeal in the case at bar should have distinguished and not followed the Turangan and Cass cases because they were in error in characterizing as criminal a review of authorizations.    R. v. Storgoff, [1945] S.C.R. 526, was also distinguished.   It was argued that the ratio in R. v. Storgoff, a case dealing with a habeas corpus application arising directly out of a criminal proceeding, could not be applicable to a Wilson review which, it was asserted, could be a proceeding entirely separate from and not necessarily linked to the criminal proceeding.     The Wilson review would therefore be subject to appeal in accordance with s. 6 of the Court of Appeal Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 7.",
            "The decision of Mr. Justice Meredith was a judicial determination of questions of fact and law arising in proceedings under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  (Invasion of Privacy ) and in relation to the charges of indictable offences then pending against Meltzer and Laison.   Without doubt, the application before him raised questions within the criminal law.   I agree with this statement of Chief Justice Laycraft in R. v. Cass, Alberta Court of Appeal, May 16, 1985 (unreported), in its application to the present case:   \"In my view it cannot be argued that a wire tap authorization, or a review of it, or an appeal from such a review, is anything other than a criminal matter.\"",
            "I think that the application before Meredith J. was an application in the Part IV.1 proceeding in which the authorization and renewal were granted.   The application had to be in that proceeding to escape being collateral.    The subject matter of the application was an order made under the Criminal Code .   The order was being reconsidered in the light of new evidence.   The criteria for reconsideration, as for the original authorization and the renewals, is found in the Criminal Code .   This application cannot be described as a civil proceeding to which the Court of Appeal Act would apply.",
            "Indeed, it is also to be observed that, while the granting of an authorization, because of its ex parte nature, may be reviewed by the court granting it, no right of appeal exists under the Criminal Code  against either the grant or refusal of an authorization.   That point was made by Mr. Justice McIntyre in Wilson at p. 123 [(1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 97].   It is not surprising that if the grant of an authorization cannot be appealed, the review of that process is also not the subject of an appeal.",
            "It is urged that in Wilson, Mr. Justice McIntyre held that an appeal from a review of the authorization is a civil matter and that the civil appeal rules therefore apply.   At p. 123 in Wilson he did refer to the body of jurisprudence to be found in the law relating to civil matters but that was merely to derive assistance in formulating rules for the criminal matter before him.   In my view it cannot be argued that a wire tap authorization, or a review of it, or an appeal from such a review, is anything other than a criminal matter. Indeed, Parliament's authority in the field of interception of private communications derives from its criminal law jurisdiction.   An Alberta statute or rule of court relating to civil matters purporting to govern an appeal from the review of an authorization would be ultra vires:  Poje et al. v. A.-G. B.C. (1953), 105 C.C.C. 311, [1953] 2 D.L.R. 785, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 516; R. v. Storgoff (1945), 84 C.C.C. 1, [1945] 3 D.L.R. 673, [1945] S.C.R. 526.",
            "I have referred to the judgments in the courts below in some detail because, in my view, they aptly dispose of this argument.   I would add that this application to review the renewal of the authorization was simply an interlocutory motion in a criminal proceeding aimed at the exclusion of evidence in that proceeding.  Section 178.14(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code  envisages an opening of the sealed packet.   The Criminal Code  provides no procedural guide for this purpose and limits the power to open to a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in s. 482  of the Criminal Code .  The fact that a procedural step deriving from civil practice was employed to meet this problem cannot be said to have converted the matter into anything approaching a civil appeal.    It was not contended that the Criminal Code  provided a statutory base for an appeal from the refusal of the review and, in my view, then this ground of appeal must fail.",
            "The second ground advanced as an alternative, in the event that the first ground fails, asks this Court to reconsider its judgment in Wilson v. The Queen.   In that case, this Court by a majority held that an authorization given by a judge with jurisdiction to do so, that is, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in s. 482  of the Criminal Code , was not subject to collateral attack before a trial judge and that the authorization must receive full effect according to its terms, save for errors or defects apparent on its face.   Any application for the review of the order, and it would appear that a review was contemplated in view of the provisions of s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) allowing the opening of the packet, should be made to the judge who made the order or a judge of the same court.   It has been said that this has led to a confusion and delay and that the trial judge should, in his capacity as trial judge, have full power to open the sealed packet and review the High Court order, regardless of the status of the trial judge, and make any necessary rulings.    That this procedure would probably expedite matters and remove some confusion may well be true.   It is not, however, a procedure provided by Parliament, and subject to arguments relating to the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ** it is not, in my opinion, open to the courts to disregard the statutory provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . If there is confusion and delay in this matter it arises from the Criminal Code  itself and, subject as aforesaid, it will be for Parliament to change.",
            "As to the confusion and delay and as to alleged procedural problems, it is my opinion that these concerns are much exaggerated.   The requirement that an application to open the sealed packet, a necessary step in any application for a review, be made to a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge, as defined in s. 482  of the Criminal Code , does not stem from this court's judgment in Wilson v. The Queen.   It is clearly provided in s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) that the packet shall not be opened except:"

Mrs. Liversain apparently became aware of the trio's intentions and was severely beaten.  She died of her injuries and the appellant, Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes were all charged with second degree murder.  The Crown proceeded against the appellant first with the intention of using the other two as witnesses.  Although he had testified at the preliminary inquiry, Benoît Deschênes refused to testify at the appellant's trial.  The Crown then applied to the judge to have the transcript of Deschênes' testimony at the preliminary inquiry introduced as evidence at the appellant's jury trial unders. 643(1)of theCriminal Code.  The trial judge held that the requirements ofs. 643(1)of theCriminal Codehad been met and that the previously taken testimony should be admitted as evidence at the trial.  The appellant's defence was that Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes and not himself inflicted the fatal injuries on Mrs. Liversain. The appellant was found guilty of second degree murder. ",

The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594).   On January 30, 1985 an authorization was granted for the interception of the private communications of the appellant, in respect of narcotics offences.  On March 1, 1985 a different judge granted an application for an authorization, authorizing the interception of the appellant's private communications concerning bookmaking offences under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.

Heikel, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 000, that the importance of the interests guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were such that an appeal on the merits should be provided."

He was served with an appearance notice requiring him to attend in court and to appear at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) offices \"for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". The latter Act, by s. 2, provides that a person in lawful custody may be subjected to certain processes of identification, the best known today, of course, being fingerprinting, which has been sanctioned by the Governor in Council pursuant to this provision; see SOR/48‑412. Section 2 reads as follows:  2. (1) Any person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable offence, or who has been apprehended under theExtradition Actor theFugitive Offenders Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view.  (2) Such force may be used as is necessary to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes and operations.  (3) The signaletic cards and other results thereof may be published for the purpose of affording information to officers and others engaged in the execution or administration of the law.  A person to whom an appearance notice is given is, by s. 453.3(3) of theCriminal Codedeemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 453.3(3) at the relevant time read as follows:  453.3...  (3) An appearance notice or promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.  This provision was subsequently amended (S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 77), but in a manner that does not affect the disposition of this appeal.  3.If a person fails to appear as required by such notice, a warrant may be issued for his arrest (s. 453.4). He is also guilty of an offence under s. 133(5) of theCode.  4.In December, 1982, the respondent, Higgins, was charged with defrauding Soo Security Motorways of more than $200 contrary tos. 338(1)of theCriminal Code. He was served with a summons requiring him to attend in court and to appear at R.C.M.P. offices \"for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". By section 455.5(5) of theCode, a person so summoned is also deemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 455.5(5) reads:  455.5...  (5) A summons may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.  A person who fails to comply with such a summons is also subject to arrest by warrant (s. 455.6) and is guilty of an offence (s. 133(4)).  5.Neither Beare nor Higgins attended at the R.C.M.P. offices as required. Both challenged the requirement that they appear for fingerprinting as being a violation of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On March 14, 1983, Rutherford J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan dismissed Beare's application without recorded reasons. On April 4, 1983, Higgins' application was also dismissed by Maurice J. who gave reasons.  6.Higgins' application was for relief pursuant to theCharter, particularly ss. 8, 11(d),24(1)and pursuant tos. 52(1)of theConstitution Act, 1982. Though Maurice J. thought the application contained procedural defects, he nonetheless proceeded to examine the merits of the case and concluded that theIdentification of Criminals Actdid not contravene ss. 8 and 11(d) and even if it did, the Act would be saved bys. 1of theCharter.  7.Both respondents appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The appeals were heard together. Both argued that a requirement subjecting an accused to fingerprinting under theIdentification of Criminals Actbefore conviction for an indictable offence infringed upon his rights as guaranteed by theCharter. Though reliance was placed onss. 7,8,9,10,11(c)and (d) of theCharter, the court restricted its considerations to s. 7.  8.By judgment dated April 14, 1987, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173, [1987] 4 W.W.R. 309, 57 C.R. (3d) 193 (hereinafter cited from (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173), and ruled that to the extent that they provide for the fingerprinting of a person charged with but not convicted of an indictable offence, s. 2 of theIdentification of Criminals Actand ss. 453.3(3) and 455.5(5) of theCriminal Codeviolates. 7of theCharterand are of no force and effect. The violation did not constitute a reasonable limit within the meaning ofs. 1of theCharter. Separate judgments were given by Bayda C.J.S. (Brownridge J.A. concurring) and Cameron J.A.  9.In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, the concept \"life, liberty and security of the person\" refers not only to physical but to mental integrity. The latter, he observed, could be subsumed in the phrase \"the dignity and worth of the person.\" As he saw it, subjecting a person to fingerprinting prior to conviction violates the elements of dignity and self‑respect inherent ins. 7of theCharter. He states at p. 182:  It is common knowledge that fingerprinting is not carried out universally but only in respect of those thought to have engaged in criminal activity ... that in the minds of the public fingerprinting is associated with criminals and criminal activity: to be fingerprinted is to be treated like a criminal. It is one thing, however, to have been found by a court to be a criminal and then to be treated like one. It is quite another not to have been so found (particularly when the person has an honest belief in his innocence) and to be treated like one. The humiliation is exacerbated when the person realizes that the fingerprints remain as a permanent record, a permanent stigma, notwithstanding the withdrawal or the dismissal of the charge. That such a person's reputation, self‑respect or dignity may suffer in the process is patent.  10.Bayda C.J.S. was of the opinion that this violation was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, given the absence of safeguards in s. 2 of the Act to prevent injury to those whom there is no need to identify or those who fall subject to the Act but are not criminals. He noted that the person in authority who has the power to require the fingerprinting need not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence. That person could be arbitrary and capricious. In Bayda C.J.S.'s view the belief of the person who laid the charge is irrelevant. The final indignity, he noted, is the lack of any requirement to destroy the fingerprints if the accused is discharged. He referred to the British statute, thePolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(U.K.), 1984, c. 60, that incorporates such safeguards.  11.Bayda C.J.S. then went on to consider whether the legislation might be saved unders. 1of theCharterand concluded that it could not.  12.Cameron J.A. arrived at the same conclusion by a somewhat different route. After disposing of a number of procedural and jurisdictional issues not raised in this Court, and referring to the decisions of this Court inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, andHunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, as establishing the applicable principles, he went on to discuss theIdentification of Criminals Actin terms of these principles.  13.To the extent that the Act applies to a person in custody, accused but not convicted of the commission of a serious crime, he stated, its purposes are to enable the identity of that person to be established for three reasons: (1) to assist in determining whether the accused committed the crime in those cases where the identity of the person who committed the crime is in issue; (2) to assist in determining if the accused has been convicted or stands charged of other crimes in order to establish whether and on what terms the accused might be released pending trial, whether the complaint ought to be presented by way of summary conviction or indictment, whether to proceed by way of second conviction, and so on; and (3) to facilitate the apprehension of the accused should he fail to appear in court. He, too, noted that there are no provisions governing the ultimate disposition of the fingerprints in the event of a withdrawal of the charge, a stay or an acquittal.  14.Cameron J.A. considered that the impugned provisions of the Act and of theCriminal Codedeprive the person affected thereby of liberty and security of the person. The person is required by law to surrender himself into the custody of the authorities, or face arrest and prosecution, and must submit to the bodily intrusions sanctioned by s. 2 of the Act. Such bodily force as is necessary to that end may lawfully be used. ",

        "Facts": " A challenged municipal by-law was repealed prior to a hearing inMoir v. The Corporation of the Village of Huntingdon(1891), 19 S.C.R. 363, leading to a conclusion that the appealing party had no actual interest and that a decision could have no effect on the parties except as to costs.  Similarly, in a fact situation analogous to this appeal, the Privy Council refused to address the constitutionality of challenged legislation where two statutes in question were repealed prior to the hearing:Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney- General for Canada, [1939] A.C. 117 (P.C.)  Appeals have not been entertained in situations in which the appellant had agreed to an undertaking to pay the respondent the damages awarded in the court below plus costs regardless of the disposition of the appeal:Coca-Cola Company of Canada Ltd. v. Mathews, [1944] S.C.R. 385, andSun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Jervis, [1944] A.C. 111.  InCoca-Cola v. Mathews, Rinfret C.J. held the result of the undertaking was to eliminate any furtherlisbetween the parties such that the Court would have been forced to decide an abstract proposition of law.  As well, the sale of a restaurant for which a renewal of a licence was sought as required by the impugned municipal by-law rendered an issue technically moot:Vic Restaurant Inc. v. City of Montreal, [1959] S.C.R. 58.  Issues in contention may be of a short duration resulting in an absence of a live controversy by the time of appellate review.  Such a situation arose inInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 2085 v. Winnipeg Builders' Exchange, [1967] S.C.R. 628, in which the cessation of a strike between the parties ended the actual dispute over the validity of an injunction prohibiting certain strike action by one party.  The particular circumstances of the parties to an action may also eliminate the tangible nature of a dispute.  The death of parties challenging the validity of a parole revocation hearing (Re Cadeddu and The Queen(1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 481 (C.A.)) and a speeding ticket (R. v. Mercure, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234) ended any concrete controversy between the parties.  As well, the inapplicability of a statute to the party challenging the legislation renders a dispute moot:Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357.  This is similar to those situations in which an appeal from a criminal conviction is seen as moot where the accused has fulfilled his sentence prior to an appeal:Re Maltby v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan(1984), 10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. C.A.)  The issue of mootness has arisen more frequently in American jurisprudence, and there, the doctrine is more fully developed.  This may be due in part to the constitutional requirement, contained in s. 2(1) of Article III of the American Constitution, that there exist a \"case or controversy\":  Section 2.  [1]  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States;--between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.  However, despite the constitutional enshrinement of the principle, the mootness doctrine has its roots in common law principles similar to those in Canada:  see \"The Mootness Doctrine in the Supreme Court\" (1974), 88Harvard L.R. 373, at p. 374.  Situations resulting in a finding of mootness are similar to those in Canada.  For example, inHall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45 (1969), a challenge to a Colorado voter residency requirement of six months was held moot due to a legislative change in the law removing the plaintiff from the application of the statute.  Mootness was also raised inUnited States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953), where a defendant voluntarily ceased allegedly unlawful conduct.  Similarly, inSibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), mootness was an issue where an accused completed his sentence prior to an appeal of his conviction.  The American jurisprudence indicates a similar willingness to consider the merits of an action in some circumstances even when the controversy is no longer concrete and tangible.  The rule that abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions will not be heard is not absolute (see:  Tribe,American Constitutional Law(2nd ed. 1988), at p. 84; Kates and Barker, \"Mootness in Judicial Proceedings: Toward a Coherent Theory\" (1974), 62Calif. L.R.1385).  A two-stage process is involved in which a court may consider the merits of an appeal even where the issue is moot. ",

        "Facts": " On June 18, 1983 the appellant and his wife separated after a 3-year marriage which produced two children, a son Michael aged 5 and a daughter Tracey aged 4.  The appellant also had a step-son John aged 11.  By agreement with his wife, Corrine Provo, the appellant was allowed access to his children and his step-son on the weekends while she retained permanent custody.  During these weekend visits the children stayed at the appellant's residence in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  When the visits started in June, 1983 the sleeping arrangements were that the appellant slept alone in a single bed in his bedroom and the two younger children, Michael and Tracey, slept in a double bed in the same room.  The older child, John, slept on a couch in the living room.  Some time before December, 1984 this arrangement was changed and the appellant and his daughter Tracey slept in the double bed while Michael slept in the single.  The explanation given for this change was that Michael and Tracey could not sleep peacefully in the same bed.  On December 26, 1984 Corrine Provo confronted the appellant with an allegation that he was sexually molesting his daughter Tracey after Tracey had complained to her.  The appellant replied that he had an erection while sleeping in the same bed as Tracey and that Tracey had wakened him up complaining.  The appellant denied any intentional wrongdoing and offered to see a counsellor with his wife if necessary.  On January 4, 1985 Tracey was examined at the Children's Hospital by a pediatrician who found that the child's vaginal opening was twice the normal size and that there was a healed laceration in the child's hymen. The police were contacted and the appellant was arrested at his home the next day.  The appellant was charged with committing incest by having sexual intercourse with his daughter contrary to s. 150 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.

S.H.M. was l7 years and 11 months old at the time of the alleged offence.   He had a prior conviction for two counts of gross indecency involving two male children aged 9 and 10 years respectively, for which he had received a suspended sentence with three years' probation.   His childhood appears to have been a difficult one.   His father was a chronic alcoholic who left home when S.H.M. was 7 or 8 years old.   S.H.M. claims that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by an older brother over a three-year period when he was 7 to l0 years old.  A pre-disposition report prepared in 1984 when he faced the charges of gross indecency suggests that this experience severely traumatized S.H.M. and may have contributed to the acts which gave rise to his conviction.   S.H.M. left home at a relatively early age, although there is some dispute between the appellant and his mother as to exactly when he did leave;  he claims he was thrown out when he was 11 years old, while she states that he left of his own volition when he was 15.   Part of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate history of his early years stems from his having a \"tendency to deceit or exaggeration\" related to attempts to gain sympathy.  S.H.M.'s pre-disposition report quotes his mother as stating that S.H.M. is no longer welcome in the family home and she is not prepared to support him emotionally or financially in the future.  S.H.M. has been the subject of several studies and reports by psychiatrists, social workers and psychologists.   The general picture that emerges is that of an extremely self-conscious, insecure young man.   Laycraft C.J.A. in the Alberta Court of Appeal described him thus:  \"He is shy, introverted, self conscious, easily hurt and perceives himself to be isolated and disliked by his teachers and his peers\".    He has also been described as \"passive\", and \"more a follower than a leader\".   Testing reveals his IQ to be at 84 which is \"low average\" or \"dull normal\".    While his physical age at the time of the offence was almost eighteen, emotionally he is described as being thirteen or fourteen.    The report prepared by the defence psychiatrist found that S.H.M. had a \"predominantly neurotic personality, having feelings of inferiority, being insecure and unassertive, and hiding his feelings\";  he is also seen as \"pessimistic and possibly suicidal\".   A social history prepared by the Edmonton John Howard Society stated that adult prison \"will be destructive for this young person\" and that \"[t]he combination of his immaturity, sexual identity confusion, and exaggerated need for approval by others will be disastrous for him in the prison culture\".

On May 9, 1985 the trial judge ruled on a motion made by the appellants and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel for a trial by a judge alone.  The trial judge held that the effect ofs. 11(f)of theCharterwas to allow the accused to elect whether to be tried by a judge and jury or by a judge alone.  He also ruled thatss. 427,428and429of theCriminal Codeviolateds. 15of theCharterbecause s. 430 gave individuals charged with the same offence in Alberta an election to be tried by a judge alone.  All three forthwith elected to be tried by a judge alone and the trial proceeded.  On July 25, 1985 the trial judge acquitted the appellant Sharon Turpin and convicted the appellant Latif Siddiqui and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel of second degree murder.  The Crown appealed and on August 20, 1987 the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the ground that the trial judge had conducted the trial without jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeal set aside the verdicts and ordered a new trial for first degree murder for all three accused.  The appellants appealed to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code.

        "Facts": " The facts out of which this issue arose are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows.  The appellants Langlois and Bédard are constables employed by the police department of the Montréal Urban Community.  The respondent Cloutier is a lawyer practising in that city.  On November 3, 1983, early in the evening, the respondent made a right turn from the centre lane of St‑Denis Street in Montréal.  In so doing, the respondent's vehicle passed directly in front of a police vehicle parked at the street corner.  The constables decided that the respondent's turn was in breach of a municipal by‑law, stopped him and asked for his driver's licence and other documents for identification purposes.  As conceded by the respondent in this Court, [TRANSLATION] \"the tone became somewhat heated\" during this exchange.  While constable Langlois was writing up a notice of violation, officer Bédard learned by radio contact with police headquarters that a warrant of committal had been issued against the respondent in the Municipal Court for unpaid traffic fines.  The constables informed the respondent and asked him to accompany them to the police station.  When they asked the respondent to get into the patrol car, the constables carried out a \"frisk\" search:  the hands of the accused were placed on the hood of the car, his legs spread and the constables patted him down.  The respondent was then taken to the police station.  Subsequent to these events the respondent, relying on the provisions of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, dealing with summary convictions, filed an information against each of the police officers for common assault, contrary tos. 245(b) of theCriminal Code.  The primary allegation made by the respondent in his pleading was that the arrest was illegal, since the police officers had no power to arrest him unless they had actual possession of the arrest warrant issued by the Municipal Court.  The respondent also argued incidentally that the police officers were not authorized to search him.  He contended that the arrest and the search constituted assaults within the meaning of theCriminal Code.  However, in the course of events, the respondent's incidental submission became his principal argument.

        "Facts": " As part of an investigation into drug trafficking, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Metropolitan Toronto Police rented an apartment in Mississauga which was to be occupied by a police informer who was working with an undercover police officer.  The apartment was equipped with audio-visual recording equipment installed in a wall.  Prior to the installation of the equipment, the informer and the undercover officer consented to the interception of their conversations, pursuant to the provisions of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  As a result of the operation, the undercover officer met a man named Paul Vidotto.  Some days after the meeting, Vidotto, the appellant Mario Duarte, and two others attended at the apartment and discussed a cocaine transaction with the undercover officer and the informer.  The undercover officer made notes of these and a subsequent conversation which he acknowledged were based upon a review of the tapes of the conversations.  The appellant was later charged with the offence of conspiracy to import a narcotic.  At trial, he challenged, on avoir dire, the validity of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCodewhich excepts from the prohibition of unauthorized electronic surveillance, the interception of conversations to which one of the parties consents.  The trial judge, Trotter J., held that the actions of the authorities infringed the appellant's rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure unders. 8of theCharterand that the evidence thereby obtained was held not admissible.  The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal which unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.  In reasons that I shall review later, Cory J.A. (as he then was) following American authorities dealing with the Fourth Amendment to the American Constitution, concluded that the interception of private conversations without a warrant but with the consent of one of the participants does not violates. 8of theCharter((1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 385).  Notice of Appeal was then filed in this Court and the following constitutional questions were stated:  1.Does section 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, legalizing the interception of private communications with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without the need for judicial authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed bys. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  2.If section 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Codedoes infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed bys. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is it justified bys. 1of theCharterand therefore not inconsistent with theConstitution Act, 1982?  The Attorneys General for Ontario and Quebec intervened to support the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a).  During the argument, counsel for the appellant, however, advanced the position that the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a) might not really arise.  That provision, he noted, was really an exception to the criminal prohibition against the interception of private communications set forth in s. 178.11(1), an exception applicable both to the police and members of the public.  Action contemplated by that exception could not be made criminal by aCharterattack on its validity.  The real question, then, becomes whether, even though such action may not constitute a criminal offence, it would nonetheless, when undertaken by an instrumentality of the state, such as the police, violates. 8of theCharter.  In my view, that is the correct approach to the matter and I shall deal with it on this basis.

        "Facts": " During the summer of 1984 the Toronto Police commenced an investigation aimed at determining the location of \"floating\" gaming houses frequented by gamblers of Oriental extraction.  As part of this investigation, police officers attended at various downtown hotels and asked the security officers in those establishments to inform them of \"anything unusual as to Orientals attending hotels\".  Some time after this request, in September of the same year, the security staff at a major downtown hotel contacted the police with information relating to the possible use of their premises for illegal gaming.  On September 17, the officers in charge of the gambling investigation went to the hotel and attended at a recently vacated room.  There the officers found that the occupants of the room had rearranged the furniture in order to form a long table suitable for gambling.  In addition, on searching the garbage the occupants had left behind, the police found many slips of paper bearing Chinese characters.  The slips bore the address and number of the hotel room, and the chief investigating officer was able to identify these notices as similar to some which he knew were distributed to potential Oriental gamblers in various restaurants in Toronto's Chinatown area.  The police checked the hotel register and discovered that the appellant, Santiago Wong, had booked this room for the 19th and 20th of the same month.  On the basis of their findings of the 17th, the police concluded that the room booked by the appellant might be used for illegal gambling.  After determining that it would not be feasible to see into the room from the roof of the other wing of the hotel, the officers in charge of the investigation concluded that only video surveillance would enable them to further their investigation by actually monitoring what transpired in the room booked by the appellant.  Notably, the police rejected the idea of employing undercover officers.  On the basis of past experience, they were certain that the gaming would be conducted behind locked doors, by and for Orientals alone.  Since the identity of Oriental police officers was well known in the community, the investigating officers concluded it would be virtually impossible to infiltrate the gambling sessions with undercover operators.  Once it was determined that video surveillance was the only feasible way of monitoring what went on in the room, the officers contacted the Metro Police Intelligence Branch and a Crown Counsel to discuss the possibility of obtaining a warrant.  These discussions left the police officers with the impression that it would not be possible to obtain judicial authorization to conduct the video surveillance.  The investigators therefore decided to proceed without this authorization, and on September 19 the police installed a video camera in the drapery valence of the room that was registered to Mr. Wong.  The camera had a lens about the size of the lead of a pencil and was attached to simultaneous recording equipment which the police monitored from an adjacent hotel room.  The police installed this equipment with the permission and co‑operation of the hotel management.  The police monitored the activities in the rooms on five separate occasions.  These observations left no doubt that illegal gambling sessions were being held in the hotel suite.  This surveillance culminated in a raid in the early morning hours of October 1, 1984.  The police entered the room with a key provided by management and found a large group of Oriental males in the suite.  A search of these persons revealed numerous slips of the type seized in the initial search of September 17.  The appellant was found to be in possession of profit lists, while debt lists were seized from some of the other occupants of the room.  The police were also able to seize gambling paraphernalia and a large amount of money found lying on the gaming table.  The appellant and ten other accused were later charged with the offence of keeping a common gaming house.  At trial, all the accused pleaded not guilty.  On September 11, 1985, the trial judge dismissed the charges against all those concerned.  He held the video surveillance of the accused to be a violation ofs. 8of theCharter, and excluded the evidence thereby obtained unders. 24(2)of theCharter.  On March 20, 1987, the Crown's appeal to the Court of Appeal against the acquittal of the appellant and the other accused was allowed, and a new trial ordered ((1987), 19 O.A.C. 365).  In a judgment to which I shall later have occasion to refer, Cory J.A., as he then was, writing for a unanimous court, held that surreptitious video surveillance would constitute a search and seizure within the meaning ofs. 8of theCharterin circumstances where the person observed by the camera had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  However, he went on to conclude that on the facts of this case the appellant could not be said to have had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held,s. 8of theCharterhad no application and the evidence of the video surveillance was therefore admissible.

        "Facts": " The appellants were charged with various offences involving drug trafficking.  They were given notice, in accordance with the statutory requirement, that evidence against them included wiretap evidence obtained under twenty-two authorizations under Part IV.1 of theCriminal Code.  The appellants applied to the Vancouver County Court for an order pursuant to s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) to have access to the contents of the sealed packets containing the affidavit filed in support of the wiretap authorizations.  The application for access was in each case supported by an affidavit stating that access to the statements by the police officers was necessary to properly conduct a preliminary hearing and in order for the accused to make full answer and defence.  Wetmore Co. Ct. J. granted access in an oral judgment, following the cases ofWilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594 (presumably the minority judgment), andR. v.

            "In considering the elements listed in s. 16(2) in the case at bar, Hansen Prov. Ct. J. first considered the element of seriousness.  She noted that \"[t]he offence of first degree murder is one of the most serious offences under the Criminal Code \".  Hansen Prov. Ct. J. then cited with approval a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal where the alleged commission of murder was referred to as a \"weighty factor\" (R. v. Clements (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 308, at p. 311).  She also appraised the circumstances, in particular, the degree of violence and insensitivity of the murder.  Though urged by the Crown to conclude that J.E.L.'s actions were premeditated, she found no evidence in this respect:",
            "Mr. Davies has urged that J.E.L.'s role in the homicide is subsidiary to that of S.H.M.  Nonetheless, at its lowest level of criminality, the case alleged against J.E.L. points to his participation in a culpable homicide that was brutal, coordinated and mercantile.  There was evidence that it was unregretted.",
            "With respect to previous findings of guilt, the pre-disposition report indicates that J.E.L. had one previous finding of guilt of theft over $200, contrary to s. 294 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and one finding of guilt of mischief contrary to s. 387 of the Code.",
            "The maximum disposition under the Young Offenders Act is three years secure custody.  Under the Criminal Code , the minimum punishment for the offence of first degree murder is life imprisonment.  In determining the adequacy of the Act, one must have regard to the degree of accountability expected bearing in  mind the age, level of maturity and development of the young person, together with seriousness and circumstances surrounding the alleged offence.",
            "Pursuant to s. 16(2)(e), Hansen Prov. Ct. J. then considered two other elements which were urged by the Crown to be relevant.  First, the Crown adduced evidence that J.E.L. escaped from the Youth Development Centre while being held in respect of the charge of murder.  The crown urged the Court to infer that the security system was inadequate to hold J.E.L.  Hansen Prov. Ct. J. rejected this submission, noting: \"The possibility of escape is a concern in all correctional institutions\".  There was no further discussion of this submission in the courts below.  While evidence of escape may be relevant to the overall assessment, as ultimately going to the societal interest in being protected from dangerous criminals and also perhaps indicating the youth's non amenability to treatment, it is open to the Youth Court judge to consider such evidence in light of all the other evidence before the court.  The second submission involved a letter allegedly written by J.E.L. showing insensitivity and lack of remorse on his part.  This evidence was rejected by the Youth Court judge:"
        ],
        "Facts": " The facts giving rise to the charges have been set out in my reasons inR. v. M. (S.H.)and need not be repeated.  Suffice it to say that the circumstances alleged by the Crown, if proven, establish the commission of a heinous offence in callous manner.   Separate charges were laid against each of the young offenders, and each proceeded independently.  In the case of J.E.L., as with S.H.M., the Youth Court judge declined to order transfer to ordinary court.  The Court of Queen's Bench upheld that ruling.  The Court of Appeal overturned it, ordering J.E.L. to stand trial in ordinary court.  J.E.L. now appeals to this Court.  The background of J.E.L. was troubled.    At the time of the alleged offences, J.E.L. was 17 years, 6 months of age.   He had prior convictions for theft over $200 and mischief, for each of which he was sentenced to six months' probation.     The pre-disposition report describes J.E.L. as enjoying a stable and close relationship with members of his family until his father's death in February, 1983.   He was extremely close to his father who apparently offered a degree of discipline which his mother was subsequently unable to do.  Following the death of his father, J.E.L.'s behaviour deteriorated; school suspensions and incidents of running away from home occurred.    Since August of 1984, J.E.L. has been in the care of Alberta Social Services in various group homes and a boarding apartment situation.  The testimony of the psychiatrists concerning J.E.L. is conflicting.   According to the defence psychiatrist, there is a strong possibility that J.E.L. can re-establish close relationships which might result in abandonment of his anti-social ways.     The Crown psychiatrist took the bleaker view that J.E.L. suffered from an untreatable personality disorder.  Tests conducted on J.E.L. reveal he is of above average intelligence;  his troubles at school and his inability to remain employed would seem to stem more from a lack of motivation than a lack of ability.

Hess  The appellant Victor John Hess was charged in 1985 unders.146(1)of theCriminal Code.  He initially entered a plea of guilty, but was permitted to change his plea when other cases raised doubts as to the constitutionality of the section.  By way of motion after plea, he raised the unconstitutionality of the section as a defence, admitting for the purposes of the motion that an act of sexual intercourse had taken place and that the complainant was under the age of fourteen years and the appellant was over the age of eighteen years.  Graham Prov. Ct. J. allowed the motion, on the grounds thats.146(1)infringeds. 15of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsby providing protection to females but not to males under fourteen years of age. He was of the view that it had not been demonstrated that the infringement was justified under s. 1, and that although biological differences between males and females might once have been grounds for affording greater protection to the latter, it was doubtful that this could be justified in these times.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, in a judgment rendered February 3, 1988, and ordered a new trial: 25 O.A.C. 43, 40 C.C.C. (3d) 193.   Dubin J.A., writing for the Court, first noted that the impugned legislation had been repealed. He then considered whether a contravention of s. 15 had been made out. In his view, the fact that young males under fourteen were not given the same protection as young females under fourteen did not violate s. 15. Under that section, it was necessary to determine \"whether the law was reasonable or fair, having regard to its purpose and effect\". Dubin J.A., noting the grave consequences which result to the victim and society and relying on the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision inR. v. Ferguson(1987), 16 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, concluded that it was neither unfair nor irrational for Parliament to have treated sexual intercourse with a female under fourteen as a more serious offence.  R. v. Nguyen  The appellant Van Hung Nguyen was charged with sexual assault and contravention of s. 146(1).  At the preliminary hearing, the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the sexual assault charge, but Nguyen was ordered to stand trial on the second charge.  He brought a preliminary motion challenging the validity of s. 146(1) on the grounds that it infringeds. 7ands. 15of theCharter.  The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the motion and the trial proceeded.  The evidence established that sexual intercourse had taken place, that the complainant was twelve years old at the time, and that the complainant did not indicate her lack of consent to the appellant because she was too scared.  Nguyen was convicted and sentenced to fifteen months' incarceration.  The Manitoba Court of Appeal dismissed Nguyen's appeal: (1989), 57 Man. R. (2d) 267, [1989] 3 W.W.R. 646.   LyonJ.A., writing for the Court, relied on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inHess, to conclude that there was no violation of s. 15, as well as the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal inR. v. Fergusonto conclude that although s. 146(1) breacheds. 7of theCharter, that breach was saved bys.1.  He noted incidentally that whileFergusonconcerned an accused who honestly but mistakenly believed that the complainant was sixteen years old, in the present case there was no suggestion that the appellant was under any misapprehension as to the complainant's age. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on October 19, 1989, [1989] 2 S.C.R. ix. ",

            "Under the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the charge.  The prosecution is set aside, not on the merits (see Jewitt, supra, at p. 148), but because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed would tarnish the integrity of the court.  The doctrine is one of the safeguards designed to ensure \"that the repression of crime through the conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a society\" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.)  It acknowledges that courts must have the respect and support of the community in order that the administration of criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of justice is best served by staying the proceedings.",
            "In the present appeal, the evidence supports no suggestion of prosecutorial misconduct or improper motive.  As well, in light of the comments in Keyowski with respect to the number of trials, little weight can attach to the fact that the Crown is attempting to try the appellant a third time.  Does the Crown's stand with respect to the re-election and the plea tip the scales in favour of prosecutorial oppression?  Under ss. 429 and 430 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as they stood at the time material to this appeal, \"an accused charged with murder anywhere in Canada except Alberta had no choice but to be tried by a superior court of criminal jurisdiction consisting of a judge of that court together with a jury\" (R. v.

C.A.), at p. 293, appeal dismissed, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296).  Proceeding on the footing that the applicable provisions of the Code were valid, the Crown objected to the proposed re-election on the ground that any such re-election would have been contrary to ss. 429  and 430  of the Criminal Code .  Such conduct does not in my view take the Crown's adversarial position too far.  The Crown was entitled to conduct the prosecution on the basis that the applicable dispositions of the Criminal Code  were constitutionally valid.",
            "In addition, s. 534(4)  of the Criminal Code  expressly recognizes the Crown's option to refuse a plea of guilty to an offence other than the offence charged:"
        ],
        "Facts": " On August 29, 1982, during the course of a bonfire party, a fight occurred between the appellant Conway and one Warren Leach.  The appellant was then 21 years of age.  There had been a history of animosity between the appellant and Leach.  Leach was stabbed sixteen times and died as a result of these injuries.  Later that same day, the appellant was arrested on a charge of first degree murder in connection with Leach's death.  The appellant was detained in custody until September 13, 1982, at which time he was granted judicial interim release.  The preliminary hearing was held in part on January 12 and 13, 1983, and was continued and concluded four months later on May 9 and 19, 1983 when the original two days scheduled in January proved insufficient to complete the inquiry.  The appellant was committed to stand trial on the charge of first degree murder.  On June 24, 1983, the trial was adjourned on consent until December 5, 1983 to deal with the appellant's application to quash the committal for first degree murder.  The application was dismissed, and on September 13, 1983 the trial date of December 6, 1983 was confirmed.  Shortly thereafter, almost 16 months after the charge, on December 15, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder but guilty of the lesser included offence of second degree murder.  The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility of parole for ten years.  The appellant was represented at this trial by Mr. Leonard Shore.  The appellant launched an appeal of his conviction which was heard in December 1984.  The appellant was represented by Mr. Brian Greenspan.  On January 24, 1985, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal partly on the grounds that the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury relating to provocation.   A new trial was ordered.  The appellant was in custody for over thirteen months between December 14, 1983 and February 1, 1985.  On the later date he was released on bail.  The appellant appeared in Assignment Court on March 4, 1985 and, upon adjournment, again on June 25, 1985, at which time a date for the second trial was set for January 7, 1986.  On November 15, 1985, counsel who had represented the appellant during his first trial, Mr. Shore, brought an application to be removed from the record.  The appellant was in the process of retaining Mr. Greenspan to conduct the second trial.  Mr. Shore's  application was refused by Osborne J. due to a concern that new counsel would be unable to prepare by January 7, 1986.  However, Mr. Shore applied again on December 5, 1985, and this time his application to be removed from the record was granted by Osborne J.  On December 10, 1985, Osborne J. further directed that the trial was to proceed on January 7, 1986.  This left the appellant one month to obtain new counsel before the second trial.  Conway did not succeed in obtaining new counsel and appeared unrepresented at the scheduled start of his second trial on January 7, 1986.  The appellant gave Osborne J. at this time a list of 11 criminal lawyers including Mr. Greenspan who had stated they could not take the case due to the short time before the trial date.  Although the Crown and the court expressed some concern at the delay, the matter was adjourned to April 21, 1986 in order to allow the appellant to retain new counsel.  The second trial began on April 21, 1986 with Mr. Greenspan acting as counsel for the appellant.  On May 1, 1986, after two days of deliberations, the jury failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared.  The matter again came up in Assignment Court on May 26, 1986. The appellant was unrepresented but a lawyer from Mr. Shore's office spoke on his behalf.  Mr. Greenspan had indicated to the accused that it would not be possible for him to act as counsel again in proceedings held in Ottawa.  There was an adjournment until June 16, 1986 in order to enable the appellant to attend with counsel to fix a date for the third trial.  At that time, although Mr. Shore spoke on his behalf, the appellant still had not retained counsel.  A trial date was nevertheless set for September 22, 1986.  A change of venue application to move the proceedings to Toronto brought by Mr. Greenspan was dismissed on August 8, 1986.  After the second trial the appellant applied for assistance under the Ontario Legal Aid Plan.  This application had been made prior to the appellant's appearance on June 16, 1986 to set a date for trial.  However, Conway had not been granted Legal Aid by the time of the June 16 appearance.  After being refused twice, the appellant was finally granted Legal Aid on certain financial conditions in July of 1986.  On the date set for the third trial, September 22, 1986, the appellant sought an adjournment as he had not been successful in retaining new counsel.  The request was granted over the objection of the Crown and the trial was set for November 10, 1986.  On October 2, 1986, the accused brought an application to adjourn the trial date as Donald Bayne, the new counsel, was only able to represent the appellant if an adjournment were granted.  The application was denied.  A further application was brought on November 4, 1986 and it was also denied.  From mid-September until the end of October 1986 at least seven criminal lawyers were approached to represent the appellant at his scheduled trial of November 10, 1986.  Affidavits from these lawyers were filed indicating their inability to represent the appellant at this short notice.  On further application, O'Brien J. ordered that the trial not proceed until immediately after the disposition of another unrelated murder trial which was set to commence on November 17, 1986.  On December 4, 1986, the appellant brought another application to adjourn before Watt J.  This time, the request made by Mr. Bayne was granted and the date for the trial was set for April 21, 1987.  On April 21, 1987, the appellant appeared before Callon J. and indicated that he wished to re-elect to be tried by a judge sitting without a jury.  The question whether theCriminal Codegave an accused this right was scheduled to be argued before the Ontario Court of Appeal in May of 1987 (subsequently reported asR. v. Turpin(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 289, appeal dismissed [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296).  The matter was adjourned by Callon J. until the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court.  Callon J. felt it best to await the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Subsequently, at the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court the date of October 26, 1987 was set for the third trial.  At the onset of the third trial, on October 26, 1987, the appellant appeared before Smith J. and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge of murder but guilty on the lesser included offence of manslaughter.  The plea was not accepted by the Crown because the appellant would not agree to a joint submission for a sentence of 15 years.  The appellant consequently brought an application to stay on the basis that holding a third trial in the circumstances would constitute an abuse of process and, as well, on the basis that in view of the time elapsed since the beginning of these proceedings, there had been a violation of his right to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed bys. 11(b)of theCharter.  The appellant was incarcerated for a period of thirteen and a half months including the period immediately after his arrest and after the first trial prior to the Court of Appeal's decision.  While on bail the appellant was subject to several restrictions including a provision that he not reside at his family home in Barrhaven.  He was also required to report to the Manotick detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police on a weekly basis.  As well, the length and number of proceedings over five years required that the appellant appear in court for two trials, one appeal and frequently for the purpose of obtaining trial dates and adjournments.  The appellant adduced evidence demonstrating that he suffered from stress, anxiety and stigmatization as a result of the delay.  The uncertainty which he faced was exacerbated by the length of the delay.  The delay resulted in the continued disruption of the appellant's family life and social life.  His education was disrupted and his health suffered.  The defence put forward by the appellant was self-defence and provocation.  Determination of these issues will depend onviva voceevidence.  The appellant alleges that his right to a fair trial has been prejudiced.

The two key witnesses for the Crown were S.M., the complainant, and C.Z., a co-accused and accomplice who had previously entered a plea of guilty to the same charge prior to trial.  S.M. was eight years old at the time of the alleged offence and nine years old at the time of the trial.  C.Z. was fourteen years old at the time of trial.  Both witnesses were duly sworn by the trial judge.  The complainant identified C.Z. and each of the appellants as participants in the alleged assault.  He testified that he thought the offence occurred in September of 1985.  When cross-examined, however, he was uncertain when the incident occurred and agreed with defence counsel's suggestion that it may have been after Easter and thus in the spring of 1986.  The trial judge summarized S.M.'s testimony as follows:  I was coming out of the bathroom, G.B. kicked the door open and pushed me back, and they sweared at me -- pulled my pants down and shoved a pencil in my bum and there was blood running out of my bum, and there was blood on the pencil.  They pulled my penis and they pulled down their pants, and they forced me to pull their penis -- and banged my head against the wall and broke my glasses.  C.Z. gave similar evidence.  He testified that he and the appellants came across the complainant in the school washroom just before recess, each kicked the complainant, put a pencil in the complainant's bum, and touched his penis.  He testified that he did not recall seeing the appellants' penises at any time.  With respect to the time of the offence C.Z. testified that the incident occurred between September 1 and September 30 of 1985 but could not remember if it was the beginning, middle, or end of September.  During cross-examination C.Z. agreed with defence counsel that the alleged assault could have happened the last week of September or the beginning of October but stated that it could not have occurred at the end of October or in November. The complainant's father and stepmother gave the only other evidence for the Crown.  Neither had been told of the incident and had suspected nothing.  The father testified that he had had the complainant's glasses repaired in September of 1985.  The only other clear evidence of S.M. breaking his glasses was an incident later in the winter when the lens popped out during gym class after an incident with another student.  The appellants all testified and denied that they had sexually assaulted the complainant at any time.  The defence also called a number of teachers who testified that there was constant supervision by teachers at the school and they were not aware of, nor advised of, anything untoward happening.  One of the teachers, Shaunda Halldorson, testified that there had been a problem in the gym with S.M.'s glasses.  All of the appellants were acquitted by the trial judge.

The complainant, E.G., a student at Sheho Elementary School, was seven years old at the time of the alleged offence and eight years old at the time of the trial.  She was sworn in by the trial judge.  Her evidence was to the effect that sometime during the noon break during the wintertime when she was in grade one she had been dragged into the boys' washroom by the three appellants and pushed into a cubicle.  She was told to pull down her pants and was touched in the area of her \"bum\" and her \"pee-pee\" by the appellants.  On cross-examination she affirmed that the incident occurred when she was in grade one and she implicated other youths as parties to the alleged offence in addition to the appellants.  At trial the appellants pointed out that the complainant was in grade one in the fall of 1984 and that the information alleged that the offence took place in December of 1985.  The Crown submitted, however, that there was other relevant evidence as to the date of the offence and that the complainant's testimony that the incident occurred in grade one must be viewed in light of all the evidence.  The evidence included:  1.The floorplan of the school showed that grades 1 and 2 were in the same room.  2.The complainant identified the washroom close to her classroom when she was in grade 2 as the room in which the assault took place.  3.The complainant also testified that she did not know the year in which the assault took place but that her mother was working at the bakery in Foam Lake at the time.  4.The complainant's mother testified that her daughter experienced various problems such as bed-wetting and nightmares during the late months of 1985 and the early months of 1986.  She further testified that this stopped abruptly once the complainant spoke with the investigating officer.  The mother had been working at Foam Lake at the end of November, 1985, but as a cook, not in a bakery.  She testified she had worked at a bakery at Foam Lake when E.G. was in kindergarten.  Dr. Richard Wollert, a clinical psychologist specializing in the treatment of young victims and perpetrators of sexual offences, testified for the Crown.  He said that there were several behavioural characteristics which are experienced by young victims of sexual offences.  These include bed‑wetting, nightmares, and anxiety.  He also testified that these problems may be caused by other occurrences in the child's life.  He stated that he had not interviewed the complainant but had spoken only briefly to her while waiting to testify.  All three appellants testified and denied any involvement in the alleged offence. ",

        "Facts": " The appellant G.B. was charged that:  On or about the 9th day of May A.D. 1986 at Sheho in the Province of Saskatchewan being a young person within the meaning of the Young Offenders Act did in committing a sexual assault on D.M. wound the said D.M. thereby committing an aggravated sexual assault contrary to Section 246.3 of theCriminal Code.  The trial judge found no evidence of wounding and therefore considered only the included offences of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm.  The complainant, D.M., a kindergarten student at Sheho Elementary School, was five years old at the time of the alleged offence.  He gave unsworn testimony at the trial.  He testified that during the afternoon recess on May 9, 1986, when he left his classroom to get a drink of water, the appellant grabbed him and carried him to the janitor's room located next to the senior boys' washroom.  According to the complainant the appellant then pulled down the complainant's pants, pulled and twisted his penis, injuring him, and leaving him in the janitor's room.  There were some discrepancies at trial with respect to the complainant's evidence as to the perpetrator(s) involved but the complainant consistently included the appellant and claimed that he was the one who assaulted him in the janitor's room.  P.M., the older brother of the victim, also gave unsworn evidence at trial.  He testified that he had seen someone he could not identify take his brother into the janitor's room.  After that person left, P.M. said that he let his brother out of the janitor's room and that D.M. then returned to his classroom.  Mrs. Seidlick, the complainant's kindergarten teacher, testified that on the day in question she noticed the complainant lying down on the carpet in the classroom away from the other students.  She also noticed that he was upset and when she tried to find out what was bothering him he complained of soreness.  She further testified that the complainant had informed her that the big boys had hurt him and that he had named the appellant as one of the students involved.  D.M's parents testified as to his physical and emotional condition on the evening of the alleged offence.  D.M. had complained to his father of a stomachache.  The father testified that when he asked his son where it hurt the child indicated the area of his penis.  His father examined him and noticed that the penis was swollen and distended.  The child was immediately taken to Dr. Raju, who examined him.  The doctor testified at trial and stated that when he examined the complainant he found that the child's penis was diffusely swollen and had a three millimetre abrasion inside the foreskin where it joins the glans.  The doctor further testified that the injury was fresh, not self-inflicted, and estimated it to have been inflicted within 24 hours of the examination.  There was other Crown evidence including the testimony of Constable Lehman and Mrs. Bolingbrooke, a teacher at the school.  Each testified that some time after the event the complainant was taken to the school and when the janitor's room was opened he exhibited signs of terror and fear.  The complainant's parents also testified that they had noticed bed-wetting and other behavioural changes in the child.

        "Facts": " The appellant, Lewis Anthony Wiggins, was the owner of a vessel, theBeaufort Spirit, which the Crown alleged was used by him in the execution of a scheme for the importation of narcotics into Canada.  Evidence at trial showed that the appellant had contacted a person by the name of Mr. Seed, who, unknown to the appellant, was a police informer, and asked him if he would like to invest in the scheme.  The informer told police about this conversation and, at their request, had further conversations with the appellant while wearing a \"body pack\", i.e., an electromagnetic transmitter, which transmitted the conversations to the police who simultaneously recorded them.  The informer was given \"seed money\" by the police which he, in turn, gave to the appellant as an \"investment\" in the scheme.  In one taped conversation, the appellant told the informer how the narcotics were obtained, that they were welded into the hull of the vessel, and how they were transported and hidden upon his reaching British Columbia.  The police conducted searches of the appellant's vessel but found no narcotics and no evidence to support the appellant's detailed account of how the narcotics had been hidden in British Columbia.  At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for the appellant explained to the jury the defence theory that the appellant was lying to the informer about the narcotics being welded into the hull of the vessel and about the manner in which it had been hidden.  The appellant did not testify.  The trial judge gave his charge to the jury on the same day the defence made its submissions.  He indicated that he would not repeat the theories of the parties as they had been well covered by the parties' counsel.  The appellant was convicted of conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to s. 423(1)(d) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The appellant then appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  He first sought to introduce fresh evidence, but this request was refused on the basis of the principles enunciated inPalmer and Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  The appellant's various grounds of appeal were similarly rejected.  The first -‑ that the trial judge erred in failing to put the theory of the defence to the jury -‑ failed because the court found this to be one of those rare cases recognized inAzoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, where it was not necessary for the judge to do so.  The second issue -‑ whether the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant's passport into evidence on the ground that a passport deposited with the police under the terms of his judicial interim release does not become available as evidence -‑ was disposed of on the simple ground that it was too late to raise the objection.  The third ground of appeal was that the appellant's privacy was invaded by the recording of his conversations with the informer.  The court cited with approval the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Sanelli(1987), 60 C.R. (3d) 142, in which it was held that s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Codedid not contravenes. 8of theCharterand that there was no \"reasonable expectation of privacy in the course of a conversation where one party to it has consented to it being intercepted and recorded\".  The court noted that the law does not require that \"when the police are aware that someone is about to divulge a private matter to another they must seek judicial authorization before that other person may listen to what is said or secretly record what is said\".  The court also rejected this ground of appeal.  On the appeal to this Court, the same issues were raised but the appellant in addition argued that the Crown had suppressed evidence of the vessel's stability information booklet which, it was alleged, would support the appellant's case.

        "Facts": " The appellant, who was 22 years old at the time, had been living with Kevin Rust for some three to four years.  Their residence was the scene of a boisterous party on August 30, 1986.  In the early hours of August 31 after most of the guests had departed the appellant and Rust had an argument in the upstairs bedroom which was used by the appellant.  Rust was killed by a single shot in the back of the head from a .303 calibre rifle fired by the appellant as he was leaving the room.  The appellant did not testify but her statement made to police on the night of the shooting was put in evidence.  Portions of it read as follows:  Me and Wendy argued as usual and I ran in the house after Kevin pushed me.  I was scared, I was really scared.  I locked the door.  Herb was downstairs with Joanne and I called for Herb but I was crying when I called him.  I said, \"Herb come up here please.\"  Herb came up to the top of the stairs and I told him that Kevin was going to hit me actually beat on me again.  Herb said he knew and that if I was his old lady things would be different, he gave me a hug.  OK, we're friends, there's nothing between us.  He said \"Yeah, I know\" and he went outside to talk to Kevin leaving the door unlocked.  I went upstairs and hid in my closet from Kevin.  I was so scared... . My window was open and I could hear Kevin asking questions about what I was doing and what I was saying.  Next thing I know he was coming up the stairs for me.  He came into my bedroom and said \"Wench, where are you?\"  And he turned on my light and he said \"Your purse is on the floor\" and he kicked it.  OK then he turned and he saw me in the closet.  He wanted me to come out but I didn't want to come out because I was scared.  I was so scared.  [The officer who took the statement then testified that the appellant started to cry at this point and stopped after a minute or two.]  He grabbed me by the arm right there.  There's a bruise on my face also where he slapped me.  He didn't slap me right then, first he yelled at me then he pushed me and I pushed him back and he hit me twice on the right hand side of my head.  I was scared.  All I thought about was all the other times he used to beat me, I was scared, I was shaking as usual.  The rest is a blank, all I remember is he gave me the gun and a shot was fired through my screen.  This is all so fast.  And then the guns were in another room and he loaded it the second shot and gave it to me.  And I was going to shoot myself.  I pointed it to myself, I was so upset.  OK and then he went and I was sitting on the bed and he started going like this with his finger [the appellant made a shaking motion with an index finger] and said something like \"You're my old lady and you do as you're told\" or something like that.  He said \"wait till everybody leaves, you'll get it then\" and he said something to the effect of \"either you kill me or I'll get you\" that was what it was.  He kind of smiled and then he turned around.  I shot him but I aimed out.  I thought I aimed above him and a piece of his head went that way.  The relationship between the appellant and Rust was volatile and punctuated by frequent arguments and violence.  They would apparently fight for two or three days at a time or several times a week.  Considerable evidence was led at trial indicating that the appellant was frequently a victim of physical abuse at the hands of Rust.  Between 1983 and 1986 the appellant made several trips to hospital for injuries including severe bruises, a fractured nose, multiple contusions and a black eye.  One of the attending physicians, Dr. Dirks, testified that he disbelieved the appellant's explanation on one such occasion that she had sustained her injuries by falling from a horse.  A friend of the deceased, Robert Ezako, testified that he had witnessed several fights between the appellant and the deceased and that he had seen the appellant point a gun at the deceased twice and threaten to kill him if he ever touched her again.  Under cross-examination Ezako admitted to seeing or hearing the deceased beat up the appellant on several occasions and, during the preliminary inquiry, described her screaming during one such incident like \"a pig being butchered\".  He also saw the appellant with a black eye on one occasion and doubted that it was the result of an accident as she and the deceased stated at the time.  Another acquaintance of the couple recalled seeing the appellant with a split lip.  At one point on the night of his death Rust chased the appellant outside the house and a mutual friend, Norman Kolish, testified that the appellant pleaded with Rust to \"leave me alone\" and sought Kolish's protection by trying to hide behind him.  A neighbour overheard Rust and the appellant arguing and described the tone of the former as \"argumentative\" and the latter as \"scared\".  Later, between the first and second gunshot, he testified that he could hear that \"somebody was beating up somebody\" and the screams were female.  Another neighbour testified to hearing noises like gunshots and then a woman's voice sounding upset saying \"Fuck.  He punched me in the face.  He punched me in the face.\"  He looked out the window and saw a woman matching the description of the appellant.  Three witnesses who attended the party testified to hearing sounds of yelling, pushing, shoving and thumping coming from upstairs prior to the gunshots.  It is not disputed that two shots were fired by the appellant.  The first one went through a window screen.  It is not clear where Rust was at the time.  The appellant in her statement says that he was upstairs, while another witness places him in the basement.  The second shot was the fatal one.  After the second shot was fired the appellant was seen visibly shaken and upset and was heard to say \"Rooster [the deceased] was beating me so I shot him,\" and \"You know how he treated me, you've got to help me.\"  The arresting officer testified that en route to the police station the appellant made various comments in the police car, including \"He said if I didn't kill him first he would kill me.  I hope he lives.  I really love him,\"  and \"He told me he was gonna kill me when everyone left.\"  The police officer who took the appellant's statement testified to seeing a red mark on her arm where she said the deceased had grabbed her.  When the coroner who performed an autopsy on the deceased was shown pictures of the appellant (who had various bruises), he testified that it was \"entirely possible\" that bruises on the deceased's left hand were occasioned by an assault on the appellant.  Another doctor noted an injury to the appellant's pinkie finger consistent with those sustained by the adoption of a defensive stance.  The expert evidence which forms the subject matter of the appeal came from Dr. Fred Shane, a psychiatrist with extensive professional experience in the treatment of battered wives.  At the request of defence counsel Dr. Shane prepared a psychiatric assessment of the appellant.  The substance of Dr. Shane's opinion was that the appellant had been terrorized by Rust to the point of feeling trapped, vulnerable, worthless and unable to escape the relationship despite the violence.  At the same time, the continuing pattern of abuse put her life in danger.  In Dr. Shane's opinion the appellant's shooting of the deceased was a final desperate act by a woman who sincerely believed that she would be killed that night:  ... I think she felt, she felt in the final tragic moment that her life was on the line, that unless she defended herself, unless she reacted in a violent way that she would die.  I mean he made it very explicit to her, from what she told me and from the information I have from the material that you forwarded to me, that she had, I think, to defend herself against his violence. Dr. Shane stated that his opinion was based on four hours of formal interviews with the appellant, a police report of the incident (including the appellant's statement), hospital reports documenting eight of her visits to emergency departments between 1983 and 1985, and an interview with the appellant's mother.  In the course of his testimony Dr. Shane related many things told to him by the appellant for which there was no admissible evidence.  They were not in the appellant's statement to the police and she did not testify at trial.  For example, Dr. Shane mentioned several episodes of abuse described by the appellant for which there were no hospital reports.  He also related the appellant's disclosure to him that she had lied to doctors about the cause of her injuries.  Dr. Shane testified that such fabrication was typical of battered women.  The appellant also recounted to Dr. Shane occasions on which Rust would allegedly beat her, then beg her forgiveness and ply her with flowers and temporary displays of kindness.  Dr. Shane was aware of the incidents described by Ezako about the appellant's pointing a gun at Rust on two occasions and explained it as \"an issue for trying to defend herself.  She was afraid that she would be assaulted.\"  The appellant denied to Dr. Shane that she had homicidal fantasies about Rust and mentioned that she had smoked some marijuana on the night in question.  These facts were related by Dr. Shane in the course of his testimony.  The appellant was acquitted by a jury but the verdict was overturned by a majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal and the case sent back for retrial. ",

After five hours of second stage labour, the child's head emerged and no further contractions occurred.  Sullivan and Lemay attempted to stimulate further contractions but were unsuccessful.  Direct pressure was applied to the uterus, causing soreness to the mother's stomach and back and some bruising.  Approximately twenty minutes later, Emergency Services were called and the mother was transported to the hospital.  Within two minutes of arrival, an intern delivered the baby using what the trial judge characterized as \"a basic delivery technique\".  The child showed no signs of life and resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.  Sullivan and Lemay were jointly charged with one count of criminal negligence causing death to the child of Jewel Voth contrary tos. 203of theCriminal Code, and a second count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm to Jewel Voth contrary to s. 204.  They were tried in the County Court of Vancouver and were found guilty on the first charge and were acquitted on the second charge.

        "Facts": " The appellant was convicted with four others (Scibetta, Criminisi, Vanderkooy, and Allen) of conspiring to import a narcotic (cocaine).  The principal evidence consisted of: (a) intercepted private communications, many of which were between Garofoli in Hamilton and Frank Savasta in Florida; (b) the evidence of Earl Smith, who was employed by Savasta to transport three kilograms of cocaine from Florida to Hamilton in November 1983; (c) the evidence of Biebuyck, as to the purchase by Vanderkooy of a quantity of cocaine in November or December 1983, and the subsequent sale and the delivery of certain of the proceeds to Scibetta; and (d) evidence confirming the presence of Smith in Hamilton in November 1983 and Savasta in Hamilton in January 1984.  The Court of Appeal held that the jury would be warranted in finding the following facts.  Garofoli in Hamilton arranged with Savasta in Florida to purchase three kilograms of cocaine.  On November 20, 1983, Criminisi and Allen flew to Florida and paid Savasta $20,000 of a total price of $61,000 for three kilograms of cocaine.  Criminisi rented a car, and the cocaine was placed in its spare tire.  Smith and Allen drove the car to Buffalo where Smith was to collect the balance of the purchase price.  Smith and Allen registered at a hotel in Buffalo, and were joined by Scibetta.  It was decided that Smith would drive the car across the border.  After crossing the border, Smith and Allen drove to a hotel in Hamilton where they registered as guests early in the morning of November 23.  Later that morning, Criminisi and Scibetta joined them at the hotel.  Scibetta removed the spare tire from the rental car's trunk, put it in his car, and drove away.  Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to the M & R Auto Body Shop, and met Garofoli and others.  The car was stored there, with the Florida licence plates removed.  Smith remained in Hamilton, attempting to collect the balance of the purchase price.  Around November 27 Criminisi paid him a further $10,000.  A few days later, Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to Garofoli's home to discuss the balance.  They telephoned Savasta at his office in Florida from a nearby pay telephone.  Criminisi spoke first to Savasta.  Then Garofoli spoke to Savasta, telling him he could be trusted to pay the balance.  While speaking to Savasta, he gave $4,790 to Criminisi which he gave to Smith.  Then Smith spoke to Savasta who told him to return to Florida.  In late November or in early December 1983, Vanderkooy and Biebuyck drove to the M & R Body Shop.  Vanderkooy went in, returned with Scibetta, and pointed to his car.  Vanderkooy and Biebuyck left, and returned about one half-hour later.  Vanderkooy again went into the shop.  He returned and drove to Biebuyck's home, where he removed a package containing a kilogram of cocaine from the trunk of his car.  The cocaine was divided into one-ounce packages.  Most of it was sold, with certain of the proceeds being turned over to Scibetta.  After Smith returned to Florida, there were several telephone calls from Savasta to Garofoli concerning payment of the money.  In January 1984 Savasta came to Hamilton where he met with Garofoli.  During the investigation, there were four orders authorizing the interception of the private communications.   They were granted September 26, September 29, November 21 and December 30, 1983, by judges of the High Court of Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario.  The evidence of Garofoli's involvement in the conspiracy is derived in large measure from private communications intercepted under these authorizations.  These included telephone conversations which ostensibly referred to the importing of various automobiles and jewelry, but which the jury were invited to interpret as referring to cocaine.  At the conclusion of avoir direto determine the admissibility of the intercepted communications, the trial judge refused to order the opening of the sealed packets containing the affidavits upon which the orders were obtained and ordered that the wiretap evidence was admissible.  The appellant did not appear for the next day of the trial.  The trial was adjourned while inquiries were made as to his whereabouts.  When it appeared that there was no explanation for his absence, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.  Pursuant to s. 431.1 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.C-34, the trial judge made a finding that he had absconded and ordered that the trial continue in his absence.  The appellant's counsel was permitted to withdraw at that point.  The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario against his conviction and sentence on numerous grounds.  It dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against sentence.

On February 7, 1985 the bodies of James McLean and Ann McLean were found in the bathroom of their home, a trailer, in Valleyview, Alberta.  A police investigation led to Martineau and one Patrick Tremblay.  Martineau, who was fifteen at the time, was charged with both murders and was transferred to adult court.  Martineau was tried by a judge and jury starting on September 12, 1985.  Thirty witnesses gave evidence including the accused.  The evidence revealed that Martineau and his friend, Tremblay, had set out one evening armed with a pellet pistol and rifle respectively.  Martineau testified that he knew that they were going to commit a crime, but that he thought it would only be a \"b and e\".  After robbing the trailer and its occupants, Martineau's friend Tremblay shot and killed the McLeans.  As they left the trailer, Martineau asked Tremblay why he killed them and Tremblay answered, \"they saw our faces\".  Martineau responded, \"But they couldn't see mine 'cause I had a mask on\".  They drove James McLean's car to Grande Prairie where they abandoned it.   The respondent was convicted of second degree murder.  The trial judge charged the jury ons. 213(a) and (d) of theCriminal Codeand ons. 21(1)and(2)of theCriminal Code.

Much of the evidence at trial came from an agreed statement of facts.  It was admitted by the appellant that he had made arrangements, several days before the incident, to return to his native country, India, along with his two children.  To this end, he purchased three airline tickets and collected them on May 2, 1986.  He also purchased a number of other items during this period, including an axe and a suitcase.  The appellant admitted that he and his wife argued over a number of matters several days before the incident, to the extent that his wife left their home in order to stay with relatives for a short time, returning only on the afternoon of May 2, 1986.  The argument that caused her to leave was precipitated in part by the appellant's decision to quit his job.  The spouses had also disagreed on numerous occasions as to whether the family should return to India.  Immediately after killing his wife, the appellant tried but failed to enlist the help of friends in order to remove her body from the home. He finally severed the body into smaller parts with an axe and disposed of them in a nearby river.  He cleaned the premises and later made attempts to enter the United States.

            "The appellant raised three arguments with respect to the affidavits.  First, it was argued that one of the authorizations was invalid because it was based upon an unsworn affidavit.  The jurat in the affidavit had not been completed by the Commissioner for Oaths, although the date had been inserted.  The Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 610 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, called as witnesses Sergeant Lamont and the agent for the Attorney General who obtained the authorization.  They were examined in chief by the Crown and cross-examined by counsel for Daniel Lachance.  On this viva voce evidence, the Court concluded that the affiant had sworn the affidavit and the jurat had been left incomplete by oversight.  Thus the authorization was not invalid.",
            "This issue goes to the validity of the authorization on its face.  The appellant relies on two arguments with respect to minimization.  First, it is argued that when paras. 3(i) and 5(h) of the authorization are read together, the authorization is overbroad and hence unlawful under the Criminal Code  and unreasonable under s. 8  of the Charter .  Second, he adopts the submission of the appellant in Garofoli that the absence of minimizing conditions creates the possibility of interception of a high number of irrelevant private communications, and thereby renders the authorization unreasonable."
        ],
        "Facts": " Aggravated Assault  The appellant and his brother, David Lachance, were convicted by Ferguson Dist. Ct. J., sitting alone, of aggravated assault of Derrick Hollett.  The appellant had become acquainted with Hollett at the Don Jail in Toronto.  In January 1985, the Lachance brothers were involved in trafficking speed with Hollett.  Hollett's debts to them are variously reported as $500 to $4,000.  Wiretap evidence showed that both the appellant and his brother were looking for Hollett to collect the money.  Hollett, however, successfully avoided them despite his promises to pay.  In one particular instance, he made the excuse that he had been arrested for breaking and entering.  He arranged to meet with the Lachance brothers at a donut shop to show them the bail papers, but did not show up.  On March 27, 1985 Hollett was visiting a friend's apartment.  The Lachance brothers arrived at about 7:00 p.m.  Hollett went to the bathroom.  The trial judge found as fact that Hollett emerged from the bathroom concealing a knife in his right hand.  He confronted the appellant, who saw the concealed knife.  The appellant punched Hollett in the face, which the trial judge found to be reasonable force used in self-defence.  The trial judge found that Daniel Lachance did not see the concealed knife, and that Hollett's threatening behaviour was not directed towards Daniel Lachance.  Daniel Lachance moved behind Hollett, held his knife to Hollett's throat, and wounded Hollett.  The appellant took Hollett's knife.  With it, he cut Hollett's face, slit his stomach area, and stabbed him in the stomach and chest.  The wiretap evidence was an important factor in the factual findings.  It confirmed elements of Hollett's testimony.  Hollett might not otherwise have made a very credible witness due to, among other things, his long criminal record.  The trial judge referred in particular to two interceptions made March 28, the day following the stabbing.  He said:  The intercepted communications which were admitted in evidence leave in my mind no doubt whatsoever that both of the accused were intent on confronting Hollett and that they were entirely satisfied with the manner in which Hollett had been dealt with physically.  The words used by them in the intercepted communications are consistent only with the conclusion that they boasted of their physical accomplishment.  Wiretaps The relevant authorizations for wiretaps were obtained with respect to the robbery of a precious metal dealer, Intercontinental Gold, in December, 1984.  Authorizations were obtained on January 31, February 8, and February 27, 1985. Each was obtained on the basis of an affidavit sworn by Sergeant John Lamont.  The intercepted communications tendered as evidence were all obtained under the February 27 authorization.  The  January 31 affidavit names 5 individuals as targets, who the police believed committed the robbery on the basis of information from an informant and other investigation.  The February 8 affidavit is substantially the same, but corrects the addresses given for two of the targets.  The February 27 affidavit repeats the contents of the prior affidavits.  It then adds new facts, set out in para. 1(i).  (i) That subsequently Sergeant Paul Landry, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force attached to the Hold-Up Squad, has informed and I verily believe:  (i)                   That on the 9th day of February, 1985, he had conversation with an informant, who has not been previously mentioned in this my Affidavit.  (ii)        That this informant told him that Art Szostak and a male he knew only as Ted set up the robbery of Intercontinental Gold previously mentioned in this my Affidavit.  (iii)      That the informant told him that the jewellery stolen from Intercontinental Gold was given to a male party he knew only as \"The Jew\" to sell.  (iv)      That the informant told him that Art Szostak and \"Ted\" have recruited at least three other men to do another robbery for them in the near future.  (At present, it is not known if there are other participants in this planned robbery.)  (v)                 That the informant told him that these three men were Daniel LaChance, his brother David LaChance and Derrick Hollett.  (vi)      That the informant told him that as a result of having been previously investigated by the police for Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, the three men were aware they were known to the police and would take measures to avoid police surveillance. In paragraph 1(j) Sergeant Lamont deposes that based on his own observations and investigations, he verily believes that the information obtained by Sergeant Landry from the informant is correct.  Later, in para. 10 of the affidavit, Sergeant Lamont repeats his belief that the targets are uncooperative and surveillance-conscious.  He deposes that the targets form a close-knit group of friends and relatives, so that any attempt to involve an undercover police officer would be futile.  He deposes that the only remaining investigative step would be to question the targets, which would be highly unlikely to assist the investigation.  He therefore concludes that the only practical investigative technique would be to intercept the private communications of the targets.  In Hollett's testimony at trial, it is apparent that he is the informant referred to in Sergeant Lamont's affidavit.  He testified in chief that he was arrested for cocaine possession in January or February 1985.  He testified in cross-examination that he lied when he told David and Daniel Lachance that he was arrested for breaking and entering, but that he lied in order to cover up his involvement with the Hold-Up Squad.  In re-examination he testified that sometime in February 1985 he began working for the Hold-Up Squad as an informant.  He told them of the involvement of the Lachance brothers in the Intercontinental Gold robbery.  He was asked by the Hold-Up Squad to \"get back in\" with the Lachance brothers, which he attempted to do.  He was aware that when he telephoned the Lachance brothers, the telephones were wiretapped.  The Hold-Up Squad asked him to arrange a meeting with the Lachance brothers, and to wear a body pak for the meeting.  Hollett agreed to do this, although he was skeptical about the idea.  Sergeant Lamont's testimony onvoir direalso supports the inference that Hollett was the informant referred to in the affidavit.  He testified in chief that part of the information implicating the Lachance brothers in the robbery was obtained from the informant, Hollett.  In cross-examination he testified that he first met Hollett in late February 1985, although his partner had had earlier contact with him.  On cross-examination he was asked why Hollett was named on the authorization.  He testified that the police had believed other offences were about to take place, although Hollett was not a suspect in relation to the offences listed in the authorization.

        "Facts": " On April 21, 1984, Michel Fortin was found dead in his home, the victim of two gun‑shot wounds in the head.  The respondent was arrested the following day and questioned by police with respect to the incident.  He had been charged and convicted, approximately three years earlier, of assaulting the victim.  The respondent refused to speak to any police officers and was released several days later.  Almost four months later, in response to renewed questioning by the police, the respondent confessed to having caused the death of Mr. Fortin.  He admitted that he had planned the event:  he had acquired a firearm for this purpose some time earlier and had entered the home of the victim on the day in question with the weapon concealed on his person. After firing two shots at the victim's head, he left the premises, threw the firearm in a river and returned to his own home.  The respondent was convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the Superior Court of Quebec.  The respondent conceded that he had committed the physical act of killing Mr. Fortin, but argued that he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant tos. 16of theCriminal Code.  Uncontradicted evidence was given at trial that the respondent suffered from a severe psychosis that made him believe that he was God and had a mission to destroy all forces of evil on Earth.  He suffered from the further delusion that Mr. Fortin was \"Satan\" and that he had to kill him in order to rid the Earth effectively of all evil forces.  The respondent knew that murder was a crime and that he would in all likelihood be arrested for this act, but he believed nevertheless that the act was necessary in order to fulfill his Divine mission.  The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the insanity defence, stating that the respondent should not be convicted if he lacked the capacity, because of disease of the mind, to appreciate the nature or quality of his act or to know that the act was legally wrong.  The Court of Appeal of Quebec unanimously set aside the respondent's conviction and substituted a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity: (1988), 48 C.C.C.

        "Facts": " The appellant, Jules Jobidon, was charged with manslaughter for the unlawful act of killing Rodney Haggart -- through the offence of assault (alternatively, through an act of criminal negligence).  The incident leading to the charge was a fist fight between the two men, in a parking lot outside a hotel near Sudbury, Ontario, on September 19, 1986.  At the date of the killing, Rodney Haggart was 25 years old.  He had consumed some beer.  His blood alcohol level, measured a few hours after the incident, was 160 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, but the trial judge found that Haggart appeared \"perfectly fine\" and \"perfectly normal\".  Jobidon, a young, fit and powerful man, had also been drinking beer prior to the fight, but in the opinion of the trial judge was not inebriated.  The two men initiated their aggression in the bar of the hotel.  With his brother and a few friends, Haggart was celebrating his impending marriage.  He approached Jobidon, who was also in the hotel with friends, and started a fight with him.  Haggart was larger than the appellant, and had previous training as a boxer.  In this first encounter, Haggart was prevailing when the owner of the hotel separated the combatants and told Jobidon and his brother to leave the hotel.  Jobidon and Haggart exchanged angry words in the lobby, and the trial judge found that the two men agreed the fight was not over.  Jobidon and his brother waited outside in the parking lot.  When the Haggart party exited the hotel their respective older brothers began fighting at the far end of the lot.  Jobidon and Haggart argued.  A crowd of people, many of whom had come outside to see the fight, gathered around them.  While Haggart and Jobidon stood facing each other, Jobidon struck Haggart with his fist, hitting him with great force on the head and face.  Haggart was knocked backward onto the hood of a car.  The trial judge determined that Haggart was rendered unconscious by this initial punch and that he appeared to be \"out cold\".  He was not moving and offered no resistance to the appellant.  Immediately after throwing that first punch, Jobidon continued forward.  In a brief flurry lasting no more than a few seconds he struck the unconscious victim a further four to six times on the head.  The trial judge found that there was no interval between Haggart's fall and the continued punching.  The punches were part of \"one single continuing transaction . . . one fluid event, punctuated by specific blows\".  The judge noted that the most reliable witness testified that it all happened so quickly he thought Haggart would bounce off the hood and resume the fight.  Instead, Haggart rolled off the hood and lay limp.  He was taken to the hospital in a coma, where he died of severe contusions to the head.  Medical evidence showed that he had sustained extensive bruising and abrasions to the head and neck.  It was determined that the cause of death was one or more of the punches he had received at the hand of the appellant in the parking lot.  The trial judge found that Jobidon did not intend to kill Haggart, nor did he intend to cause the deceased serious bodily harm.  However, the possibility of injury more serious than a bruise or bloody nose, such as a broken nose, was contemplated.  Jobidon intentionally hit Haggart as hard as he could, but believed he was fighting fair.  He did not depart intentionally from the kind of fight that Haggart had consented to.  Jobidon believed that Haggart had consented to a fair fight, the object of which was to hit the other man as hard as physically possible until that person gave up or retreated.  The trial judge also found that, although mistaken, and not supported by objective facts, Jobidon honestly believed that after Haggart had been struck onto the hood of the car he was merely stunned, but still capable of fighting back, and still trying to fight.  Jobidon was tried before a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and was found not guilty of manslaughter:  (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 340.  The judge held that Haggart's consent negated assault, and held further that Jobidon had not been criminally negligent.  The respondent appealed the judge's holding of assault to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal, and substituted a guilty verdict on the charge of manslaughter:  (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 176.  Judgments in the Courts Below ",

        "Facts": " The appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of Charmayne Manke and was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years.  The Court of Appeal for Alberta dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from conviction.  The body of the victim was found lying in a farmer's field at about 7:00 a.m. on April 14, 1984.  An autopsy revealed that she had 12 stab wounds to her neck and three to her head.  She bled to death as a result of a wound to her carotid artery.  At trial, evidence was adduced to establish that the appellant hailed a cab outside a gay night-club and asked the victim, the cab driver, to take him to his motel room.  When they arrived at the motel, the appellant asked her to wait for him while he picked up his luggage.  At that time the appellant also retrieved a knife from his room.  The appellant, upon his return, sat in the front passenger's seat.  A witness who observed the victim's driving testified that her driving pattern was very erratic following the departure from the motel. After his arrest, the appellant told the R.C.M.P. that he had been drinking and taking drugs before getting into the cab.  He remembered being in a field and wanting the cab driver's money.  When he took her money, he had the knife displayed.  At his request, the victim got out of the cab and his next memory was of his standing on the highway attempting to flag down a truck. In a later statement he remembered that he had initially pulled out the knife on entering the cab at the motel and told the victim to keep driving until he told her to stop.  It was further alleged that the appellant made an incriminating statement to another prisoner while in custody awaiting trial to the effect that he had stabbed the victim inside the cab and again outside the cab because she called him a \"faggot\".  The fellow inmate also testified that the appellant had made reference to having \"had control of where they were going\" in the cab.  In the course of its deliberations, the jury sent the trial judge two questions:  (1) \"what causes first degree murder to drop to second degree murder?\" and (2) \"please clarify forcible confinement a little more, that is, if the death occurred outside the cab, was the victim forcibly confined, if, for instance, she ran and attempted to escape, was caught by the accused and killed, was she forcibly confined at the time of death -- when does forcible confinement end?\"  The trial judge first noted that first degree murder does not \"drop\" to second degree murder and then responded in the following way:  It is not first degree murder if, and I will tell you in what circumstances it is not first degree murder, if you find on the facts that there was no forcible confinement.  It is not first degree murder if you find a robbery without a forcible confinement.  It is not first degree murder if you find no planning or deliberation but, once again, as I told you when I charged you, don't concern yourself with that one, because the Crown conceded that this is not a case of planning and deliberation and I concur, but there was some evidence that you might have found that in any event, so, I charged you on it.  So, that one I would suggest you should put aside....  It is not first degree murder if you find in fact you have a doubt as to whether the accused did form the intent to forcibly confine....  It is not first degree murder if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the forcible confinement ended and this doubt must be resolved in favor [sic] of the accused.  Finally, it is not first degree murder if death occurred to facilitate flight after committing or attempting to commit forcible confinement. The jury returned about two hours later with a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. ",

            "In Vaillancourt, this Court dealt with s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  and did not hold that subjective foresight of death was constitutionally mandated for the crime of murder.  Section 213(a) satisfies the objective foreseeability standard, and if all the elements of s. 213(a) are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, a murder conviction can validly and constitutionally obtain.  As I discussed in Martineau, s. 213(a) is entirely different than s. 213(d) in its historical background, in its consistency with the test in Vaillancourt, and in its resemblance to similar provisions enacted in other common law jurisdictions.  Therefore, I must respectfully dissent from my colleague's disposition for the reasons stated in Martineau.  I would allow this appeal, reverse the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and restore the conviction entered at trial.",
            "With respect to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, no constitutional question was stated and it is not an issue in this appeal."
        ],
        "Facts": " The respondent was convicted of second degree murder in connection with the killing of the wife of the manager of a supermarket.  The respondent became involved in a plan with two other accomplices to abduct and hold for ransom the victim.  Various phone calls were made to the husband of the victim after she was kidnapped demanding ransom.  The victim was then shot and killed by one of the respondent's accomplices. The Crown alleged that the respondent was a party to the kidnapping and shooting of the victim by virtue of ss. 21(2), 212, 213(a) and 213(d) of theCode.  A witness at the trial, David Drew, gave evidence to the effect that while bowling the respondent told him of his involvement in the kidnapping. The respondent told Drew that his role was to watch the comings and goings of people at the home of the victim, and to give the times to his accomplice.  He described how all three had followed the victim, grabbed her in an alleyway, hauled her into a van, tied her feet and hands and gagged and blindfolded her.  The witness Drew also claimed that the respondent told him how they transported the victim to Burnaby Mountain where one of the respondent's accomplices took her out of the vehicle and shot her.  The credibility of Drew was severely attacked in cross-examination, especially on the grounds that he had 15 criminal convictions, he was arrested as a suspect in the murder and that the victim's gloves were found in the garbage behind his flat.  The respondent was convicted of second degree murder, following deliberations by the jury that lasted three days.

        "Facts": " The appellant, Emerson Raymond Broyles was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged murder of his grandmother.  He had been living with his mother until she threw him out of the house in January or February of 1984.  Broyles then lived with a number of people, including his grandmother, Lorraine Briggs.  Briggs had a one bedroom basement suite in a house owned by an elderly man.  Briggs slept in a camperized van which she parked in the back of the house, and which she drove to work.  When Broyles stayed with her, he slept in an upstairs bedroom.  Briggs worked as a cook at the Edmonton Journal Cafeteria.  She started work at six in the morning, and was never late.  On June 26, 1984, Briggs did not show up for work.  Repeated phone calls to her home by her supervisor went unanswered.  On July 3, Briggs' body was found under the stairwell in her home, wrapped in green plastic garbage bags.  The body had begun to decompose.  The cause of death was asphyxia resulting from strangulation; two coils of thick rope were still wrapped tightly around her neck when she was found.  The body was dressed in a long sleeved sweater, a camisole and a nightie with a bra loosely arranged on the body but not in place.  The nightie had been pulled up and the thighs and genital area exposed but it was impossible to say if Briggs had been sexually molested.  A palm print was found on one of the garbage bags which was positively identified as being that of the accused Broyles.  In the expert opinion of an R.C.M.P. laser expert, the print was \"most likely placed on the bag at a time when there was an item in the bag\".  On July 4, Broyles was charged with two counts of forgery.  On July 6, he was charged with murder.  The only evidence implicating Broyles in the murder was circumstantial.  Broyles was seen driving his grandmother's van at seven or seven thirty on the morning of her disappearance.  He drove the van until his arrest on July 3.  Broyles made numerous inconsistent statements about the events surrounding his grandmother's disappearance.  Of particular importance on this appeal are statements made by Broyles to Todd Ritter.  Ritter was Broyles' friend.  He was asked by the police to visit Broyles wearing a body pack recording device.  Although Broyles did not admit to killing his grandmother to Ritter, he did admit that he knew she was dead the day she went missing.  Broyles added, \"[b]ut the cops don't know that I knew she was downstairs.  Only my [lawyer] knows that.  And now you do\".  Broyles was convicted at trial before a judge and jury of second degree murder.  He was given the minimum sentence of life in prison without eligibility for parole for ten years.  Broyles was advised of his right to counsel when he was first arrested for fraud on July 3.  At the station, Broyles asked to call a lawyer.  He was given a telephone and a telephone book, and left alone to make a telephone call.  Broyles was seen to punch numbers into the phone, but he did not appear to be talking.  Broyles was then questioned by Detective Anderson.  He was told that he was not obliged to say anything unless he wished to do so, but that anything he said might be given in evidence.  The interview lasted from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on July 3.  Detective Anderson identified himself as being from the Homicide Branch of the Edmonton City Police.  He did not tell Broyles that he was a suspect in the disappearance of the deceased Briggs.  The interview was brought to an abrupt end when Anderson was called out of the room to be informed that Briggs' body had been discovered.  Anderson began a second interview of Broyles at 11 p.m. on the same day.  Anderson testified that, at the beginning of the second interview, Broyles was not a suspect in a homicide.  Anderson added that at that time the police were not even sure that what they had was a homicide.  Anderson brought the interview to an end at 11:30 p.m. because he thought he would get nothing new from Broyles.  Anderson then processed the paper work for the forgery charges.  However, Broyles was not released because the \"investigation of the `suspicious death' was not concluded so they kept him in the holding area in case they wanted to talk to him again ....\"  Detective Stewart saw the body of the deceased that same night at 10:25 p.m.  He testified that he suspected that it was an unnatural death because of the way in which the body was found wrapped in plastic bags and entwined in ropes.  He returned to headquarters, where it was decided that he would interview Broyles.  Broyles was questioned by Stewart beginning at two in the morning on the same night.  He was again given the caution about not being required to say anything.  The interview was tape‑recorded.  There was some question whether Broyles had asked for a lawyer during this interview, but the trial judge ruled that the relevant part of the tape was inaudible.  Stewart testified that neither before nor after the interview was he prepared to charge Broyles with murder.  Broyles was questioned again shortly before three in the morning of the same night by a Detective Peters.  He was given the caution once again.  Peters had viewed the body between 10:30 p.m. and 1:10 a.m. of the same night.  He suspected foul play.  He suspected Broyles but did not have the basis to charge him.  The interview ended at 3:39 a.m. on July 4.  On July 6, Broyles was charged with murder.

C-34 (now s. 230(c)).  The appellant challenges the constitutional validity of s. 213(c) both alone and in combination with s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .",
            "The appellant was tried by a judge and jury on a charge of second degree murder.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge described three possible grounds upon which the appellant could be found guilty.  First, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found guilty of aiding and abetting an intentional killing by the combined operation of ss. 21(1) and 212(a) (now 229(a)) of the Criminal Code . Secondly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined operation of ss. 21(2) and 213(a) (now 230(a)) of the Criminal Code ).  Thirdly, the jury was instructed that the appellant could be found guilty as a party to a murder by the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (c) of the Criminal Code .  The trial judge clearly stated that the appellant could be found guilty of murder whether or not he knew or ought to have known that the victim's death would result in the circumstances.",
            "The jury found the appellant guilty on the charge of second degree murder.  This verdict was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal: (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 45, 31 O.A.C. 21.  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the appellant could be convicted on the combined application of ss. 21(2) and 213(c).  The trial judge informed the jury that, by the operation of ss. 21(2) and 213(c), the appellant could be convicted as a party to murder even if he did not have objective foresight of the death of the victim.  The Court of Appeal found, therefore, that the instructions were not consistent with the judgment of this Court in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  (It should be noted that the Court of Appeal's judgment in this case was rendered prior to the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.)  The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, invoked the curative provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iii)), in order to uphold the appellant's conviction.  In dissenting reasons, Cory J.A. (as he then was) disagreed with the majority on this point.",
            "The appellant relies on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, supra.  Martineau involved a challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  A majority of the Court (Dickson C.J., Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.) held that s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  requires proof that an accused had subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim before a conviction for murder can be sustained. Under s. 213(a), however, an accused could be convicted of murder whether or not he intended to kill his victim or knew that death was a likely result of his conduct.  The provision thus violated ss. 7  and 11( d )  of the Charter  and was declared to be of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .",
            "In my opinion, a correct reading of Martineau does not support the respondent's submission.  In Martineau, as I noted above, this Court was asked to pronounce on the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  To answer this question, it was necessary to determine the minimum degree of mens rea required by the Charter  for the offence of murder.  The determination of this minimum constitutional mens rea requirement was therefore the live issue before this Court. Consequently, our finding in Martineau, that proof of subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a conviction for murder and that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  violated the Charter  since it did not embrace this requirement, was not obiter dictum.  This finding was the ratio decidendi of the decision.",

Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, I respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Lamer C.J. and Wilson J., as to the proper resolution of these questions.  In view of the peculiar circumstances of this case, including the fact that it was heard on the same day as Chaulk and that the result for the accused is not affected, I am issuing these reasons notwithstanding the prior issue of judgment in Chaulk, which is binding.  I will therefore address one of the issues raised in this case in view of my conclusions in Chaulk.",

        "Facts": " Prior to the time of the offence, the accused had lived with his parents in New York State.  Evidence was adduced at trial to establish that he had suffered from psychiatric problems since adolescence and would periodically leave his parents' home without warning to go on extended trips.  Evidence was also admitted which established that the accused was a suspect in a murder which had taken place in New York State, and had been ordered to submit to the authorities by March 7, 1987, in order to provide hair and blood samples.  The accused left his parents' home in New York State on March 3, 1987 and travelled by car through Quebec and on to New Brunswick.  Several days later, the accused shot and killed the highway patrol officer who had stopped him for speeding.  At trial, the evidence pertaining to the New York State homicide was admitted after avoir dire.  The trial judge held that while the evidence was highly prejudicial to the accused, it was relevant and probative to explain why Romeo had left his parents' home five days prior to the shooting and it therefore countered the defence of insanity.  Certain prejudicial remarks were made by Crown counsel during his address to the jury, with respect to the expert testimony of a defence witness: ",

        "Facts": " The two respondents, Sutcliffe Logan Jr. and Warren Leroy Johnson, together with two other co-accused, Hugh Logan (the brother of respondent Logan) and Clive Brown, were all charged with a number of offences arising from a series of robberies in the Toronto area.  This appeal pertains only to the charges against the two respondents for attempted murder which resulted from an incident during one of the robberies.  The facts surrounding the incident are as follows.  At around 11:00 p.m. on September 23, 1983, Hugh Logan, Clive Brown and the respondent Warren Johnson entered a convenience store, wearing masks and armed with revolvers.  Hugh Logan shot the lone clerk, Barbara Turnbull, in the neck, causing severe injuries.  The cash register was robbed and the men fled.  While awaiting trial on the charges, the respondents were held in protective custody in a jail in the Toronto area.  Shortly before the trial, the police received information from an informer that the respondent Sutcliffe Logan was boasting openly about his involvement in the planning of the robberies, including the one from which the attempted murder charges arose.  Two undercover police officers were placed in protective custody with the respondents, posing as two persons arrested on drug charges.  The officers struck up an acquaintance with the two respondents who made certain inculpatory statements.  The officers testified that they did not encourage the respondents to talk, but merely provided the opportunity for the making of the statements.  The officers made notes of the conversation immediately following the conversation during what they pretended was a visit from an articling student from their lawyer's office.  These statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  Also during the course of the trial, the respondent Warren Johnson took the stand and, while admitting that he was one of the robbers, testified that he had no intention to shoot anyone and that there had been no discussion concerning the use of guns.  In his charge to the jury with respect to the respondent Warren Johnson, the trial judge said that \"you may well have considerable doubt whether he knew or should have known that one of his group would probably shoot somebody with the intention to kill\".  With respect to the respondent Sutcliffe Logan, he stated that \"you would then have to consider whether he knew or should have known that one of the group would probably, in the course of the robbery, shoot someone with intent to kill\".  In his explanation of s. 21 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the trial judge instructed the jury that \"[i]t must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew or ought to have known that someone would probably shoot with the intention of killing\".  Hugh Logan was found by the jury to have been the one who shot the victim.  The respondents were convicted by the jury of a number offences including the attempted murder of Barbara Turnbull.  The respondents appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.  The Court of Appeal allowed their appeals with respect to the convictions for attempted murder, and substituted convictions for armed robbery in their stead. The only issue before this Court is the constitutionality ofs. 21(2)of theCriminal Code. ",

        ],
        "Facts": " The Court of Appeal found there was no abuse of process orCharterviolation in theCrown's staying of proceedings before the first judge after the adverse ruling, and then recommencing them before a new judge.  It stated thatCrowncounsel was not simply circumventing an unfavourable ruling, but was protecting an important public interest. Observing that the use of a stay must remain subject to judicial review, it concluded that \"having regard to the public interests with which theCrownwas concerned, there was compelling reason to stay the proceedings\".  In essence, the Court of Appeal is saying that the use of a stay to circumvent an adverse ruling is legitimate because theCrownhad a good reason founded in public interest for following the course it did.  I question whether such reasoning is sufficient to avoid the inference of abuse of process.   As this Court stated inKeyowski,supra, theCrown's good faith and motive are only two of the factors to be considered in determining whether an abuse of process is made out.    The same has repeatedly been held with respect toCharterbreaches; under theCharterlack of good faith and motive are irrelevant on the question of whether the accused's rights have been breached, although they may be considered unders. 24(2)in determining the use to which evidence obtained as a result of a breach may be put.   It would appear at least necessary to take the further step of examining the magnitude of the affront to justice and fairness against the public interest in prosecution.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, moreover, fails to fully address the real concerns raised by theCrown's conduct -- concerns relating to judge-shopping, the impartiality of the administration of justice and the integrity and dignity of the judicial process.  I have the same concerns with regard to the reasons of my colleague, Cory J.   He, too, emphasizes that theCrownacted in good faith and that its actions were not abusive, in the sense that they were aimed at protecting the identity of a police informer.  This, while relevant, is insufficient in itself to justify an abuse of process.  Cory J. makes two further points.  TheCrown, he says, had no alternative but to stay the trial in order to fulfil its duty.  I cannot agree.  TheCrown, faced with the evidentiary ruling which might have led to disclosure of the informer's identity, could have stood the witness down and declined to call further evidence.   The result would probably have been an acquittal.   TheCrownthen could have appealed the acquittal on the ground of the judge's erroneous ruling in the usual way, asking for a new trial.    This is what happened inR. v. Banas and Haverkamp(1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 164.  There the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from an acquittal made after theCrowndeclined to lead evidence following an adverse ruling.  Martin J.A. stated at p. 169:  We do not think that theCrown, in the circumstances, is precluded from appealing the directed verdict becauseCrowncounsel decided not to continue with the trial which he considered would be fruitless and which would not result in a conviction due to the erroneous exclusion of vital evidence.  We are satisfied that if the trial judge had not excluded the evidence of the intercepted private communications the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been the same.  If the Crown had followed this course in the case at bar the concerns to which I have alluded would have been avoided.   TheCrowncould not be accused of judge-shopping, since the new trial would be the result of a court decision rather than aCrowndecision.  Concerns for the impartiality of the administration of justice would not arise, since the critical decision would be made by the Court of Appeal where the accused may be fully heard.   And the integrity and dignity of the judicial process would be preserved, in that the adverse ruling would not be circumvented by the act of theCrown, but would be properly set aside by an appellate court.  Finally, Cory J. alludes to the fact that the accused was not prejudiced by way of delay since he was at all times in custody on another matter.  Generally speaking (and leaving to one side the question of trial delay unders. 11(b)of theCharterwhere differing views have been expressed) it is not incumbent upon an accused to demonstrate actual prejudice as a condition of being able to rely on hisCharterrights.  Nor does prejudice figure prominently in the jurisprudence on abuse of process.  Finding myself unconvinced by the reasons enunciated in the court below or by Cory J. for the proposition that abuse of process or breach of theCharterhas not been made out, I find it necessary to embark on my own analysis.  Guidance as to the content of \"oppressive\", \"vexatious\" and \"contrary to the fundamental principles of justice\", the basic test for abuse of process, may be had from the cases which have considered that doctrine.  Those cases invoke concerns for the fairness of the process from the vantage point of the accused as well as the public interest in proper functioning of the judicial system.   The specific concerns raised in this case involve the spectre of judge-shopping, concern for impartiality of the judicial process, and concern for the maintenance of the integrity and dignity of the judicial system and the judges within it.   These concerns must be balanced against the public interest in prosecuting crimes to ascertain whether they outweigh that interest with the result that allowing the proceedings to stand would tarnish the image of the court.  Each of the concerns I have raised may be seen to involve a fundamental principle of justice underlying our community's sense of fair play and justice.   A system that allows the Crown an advantage in choosing or changing judges, a system which either in fact or appearance is partial, a system which permits a judge's ruling to be circumvented other than by the normal appeal process -- such a system would be open to the charge that it offended the fundamental principles of justice upon which our society rests.  By the same token, proceedings which permit such abuses might be characterized as \"vexatious\" or \"unfair\".  The question is whether the apparent concerns are of such gravity that they may be said to outweigh the public interest.  In my view the answer is yes.   The public has an interest in prosecuting crimes as well as in protecting the identity of informers.   But, as I have already suggested, both these interests could have been met by adopting the alternative of calling no further evidence and appealing the resulting acquittal.   In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the public interest justifies or offsets the affront to justice and fairness involved in the course theCrownchose to follow.   The situation, moreover, falls within the rubric of \"the clearest of cases\".   The deviation from the fundamental principles of justice is clear and, being unnecessary, incapable of justification.   I conclude that the requirements for abuse of process are clearly met in this case.  I conclude that theCrown's conduct in staying the proceedings to avoid an adverse judicial ruling and then recommencing them establishes the case for abuse of process.  Having so concluded, it is unnecessary to consider the position under theCharter. I leave the question of remedy to later in these reasons. ",

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 246.1 (now s. 271) of theCriminal Code.  The charge arises from an incident which occurred in the early morning hours of December 1, 1984.  The appellant was arrested later that day.  Two police officers attended at his home where he resided with his parents.  Upon arrest, the appellant was informed of his right to counsel.  Immediately after this, his father, Mr. Bain, told him not to say anything until he had seen a lawyer.  While his son got dressed in preparation to accompany the police, Mr. Bain, with the help of one of the police officers, attempted to retain a lawyer by looking through the Yellow Pages.  After being unsuccessful with two or three numbers, the police officer gave him a business card with his telephone number on it.  He told Mr. Bain that when a lawyer had been retained, the lawyer should call the officer at the number on the card.  The appellant then left with the officers.  After both officers returned to the car, they drove off with the appellant and parked down the street.  The police officers updated their notebooks and were discussing between themselves what had occurred in the house.  According to one of the officer's (McIntyre) testimony in chief, the appellant initiated an inculpatory conversation.  During his testimony on thevoir dire, the appellant denied making some of these statements; in particular, he denied making the inculpatory admissions.  Upon arrival at the police station, the appellant was placed alone in an interview room.  About 25 minutes later, a lawyer who had been retained by Mr. Bain called for the police officer.  McIntyre returned the telephone call 10 minutes later.  The lawyer told McIntyre that he had been retained by the appellant's parents on behalf of the appellant.  McIntyre informed the lawyer of the circumstances of the investigation and of the alleged sexual assault and told the lawyer that the appellant would probably be released later that day.  The lawyer could not attend at the police station that day so he simply told McIntyre not to take any statement from the appellant until he, the lawyer, was present.  On the stand, the lawyer could not remember whether he had asked to speak to the appellant.  Following this telephone conversation, McIntyre (and another officer, Chisholm) went into the interview room with the appellant.  According to the appellant's testimony, he asked  whether his father had called. McIntyre told him that his father had not called.  The appellant said that he wanted to contact his father to find out if his father had retained a lawyer.  McIntyre told the appellant that he could call his father later.  At no time did McIntyre tell the appellant about the telephone call from the lawyer.  The police officers initiated an interrogation of the appellant.  The appellant told the officers that he was very impaired the previous night due to the intake of a considerable amount of alcohol as well as one \"hit\" of L.S.D.  The officers then questioned the appellant about his prior relationship with the complainant.  He was also questioned about his interaction with the complainant on the night in question.  On April 21, 1987, the appellant was tried before a judge and jury in Brampton, Ontario, on a charge of sexual assault.  Following arraignment, but before the first prospective juror was asked to step forward, appellant's counsel sought a ruling that both the Crown and the defence each be limited to four peremptory challenges and that the Crown be denied the power to stand jurors by.  The trial judge made the requested ruling based on his own holdings to the same effect in other cases.  He considered himself bound by his own ruling \"until the Court of Appeal rules otherwise\".  The Crown's objection was noted.  The jurors were then selected with both the defence and the Crown exercising their four peremptory challenges.  Following a 14-day trial, the jury acquitted the appellant.  On January 31, 1989, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal ((1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 250) and ordered a new trial.  The appellant appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. ",

        "Facts": " The indictment against the appellants reads as follows:  Between the 5th day of December, 1983 and the 19th day of February, 1984, in the City of Kitchener, in the Judicial District of Waterloo; in the City of Sarnia, in the County of Lambton; and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario; and in the City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec; they did unlawfully conspire and agree the one with the other or others of them, and with Brent Howard Harding and Douglas Patrick Reidt, and with a person or persons unknown, to commit an indictable offence, to wit:  traffic in a narcotic, to wit:  cocaine, contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, thereby committing an indictable offence, contrary toSection 423(1)(d) of theCriminal Code of Canada.  There have been two trials on the indictment.  The evidence called by the Crown in both trials was virtually the same.  In neither case was evidence called by the defence.  The principal Crown witness was Sgt. Myny, a police officer from Michigan.  Phase I  Sgt. Myny's testimony revealed that he arrested one \"Sue Ellen\" on a cocaine trafficking charge in December of 1983.  In exchange for a  promise of lenient treatment, Sue Ellen agreed to introduce Myny to other cocaine dealers.  Pursuant to her undertaking, she arranged to have Sgt. Myny meet a person named Brent Harding at a restaurant in Windsor, Ontario, on December 14, 1983.  Harding was then residing in Kitchener.  According to Sue Ellen, he imported cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia.  Sue Ellen had acted as a \"mule\" and carried the cocaine into Michigan to Harding who would then smuggle it into Canada.  During the meeting of December 14, Sgt. Myny, Harding and Sue Ellen discussed the possibility of Harding's arranging for Myny to purchase cocaine.  Two suppliers were discussed, one Florida supplier named Williams and a \"West Palm Beach\" supplier.  It was agreed that Harding would purchase one kilo from the West Palm Beach supplier for $40,000 and then charge Myny $5,000 for acting as the go-between.  At the same meeting, Harding advised that he had a partner who was later identified as Douglas Reidt.  The appellants Douglas and Douris were not mentioned during this meeting, they were not involved in this initial agreement and they were not connected in any way with the Florida suppliers.  It was agreed that the cocaine would be delivered in Michigan and paid for in American dollars.  Two days later, on December 16, Harding informed Myny that the deal would now cost $50,000, that Harding's partner, Reidt, would make the arrangements and that it would take a couple of days to obtain the cocaine.  The arrangement was that Harding would contact Reidt who would in turn go to the source.  Harding and Myny arranged to meet with Reidt in London, Ontario, on December 20.  On that day, Harding arrived without Reidt and refused to complete the transaction.  He gave as an excuse that he did not know Myny well enough and suspected that he might be a police officer.  On December 22, Sue Ellen advised Myny that Harding was ready to complete the deal.  She said that they had been testing him at the December 20 meeting.  Further negotiations led to the final agreement that Myny would purchase two kilos of cocaine for $100,000 U.S.  A meeting was arranged for January 6 in Port Huron, Michigan, to finalize the details.  The transaction itself was to be completed on January 8.  It was agreed that Myny would show his money to Harding and Reidt at the meeting, who would then telephone the Florida supplier.  The supplier, in turn, would then travel to Michigan and deliver the drugs to Myny.  The proposed January 6 meeting was delayed because Harding was having problems getting in touch with the supplier.  On January 9, Harding informed Myny that the supplier had refused to make delivery in Michigan.  Myny stated that he was unwilling to go down to West Palm Beach to take the delivery.  As a result, the deal was frustrated and came to an end on January 9, 1984.  Phase II  Harding phoned Myny again on January 12, 1984.  This time he informed Myny that he had a \"new player\".  Arrangements were made to meet in Sarnia on January 14.  On that date, Harding introduced Myny to the two appellants in a Sarnia tavern.  The wiretap evidence reveals that Harding phoned Reidt several times between January 9 and January 12.  On January 12, Harding asked Reidt for the number of the \"guy on Weber Street\".   Douglas lived on Weber Street.  As was the situation in Phase I, Reidt was not the supplier, but he was Harding's assistant in contacting the appellants and appears to have been very much involved in the organization of the deal.  At the January 14 meeting, the appellant Douris told Myny that the transaction would take place within four days of Myny's advising him that he was ready to take delivery.  Once again, the sale was to be for two kilos of cocaine at $50,000 each.  Myny made certain that the appellants would take care of Harding's share out of the proceeds of the sale.  Douris indicated the following procedure for taking delivery:  Douris and Myny would meet in a Michigan hotel to complete the delivery of the cocaine and payment for it.  Each would have the assistance of a courier.  Douglas told Myny that Harding's previous deal fell through because he was dealing with amateurs.  He told Harding that he had done his part and that the appellants would now deal with Myny.  The next day, January 15, Myny accepted the offer put forward by Douglas and Douris.  On that same day, the telephone surveillance evidence and the wiretap evidence confirmed that Harding was meeting the appellants in Kitchener at the time that Myny confirmed his purchase of the cocaine.  The events of the next few days revealed that the deal was not going as planned.  Harding informed Myny that the appellants wanted him to take delivery in Canada.  On January 31, Harding said that Douris had told him that the drugs would be ready in three days.  Myny requested another meeting to discuss the changes to the deal, but this meeting never took place and, as Myny expressed it, the deal died around February 4, 1984.  Phase III  Two and a half months later, Harding re-established contact with Myny and arranged to meet him on April 30.  At this meeting, Myny dealt with both Harding and Reidt and an agreement was reached whereby they were to deliver three kilos of cocaine to Myny in Michigan.  The delivery was duly made, both Harding and Reidt were arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to the mandatory term of life imprisonment for conspiracy to deliver an amount of cocaine exceeding 650 grams.  The appellants were not, in any way, involved in this last transaction.  When eventually arrested, Douglas told the police that he knew of Harding and Reidt's arrest and had been waiting to be arrested.  He did not deny his involvement, but said that his role was not as big as that of Harding and Reidt.

        "Facts": " (a)Agency Relationship ‑‑ The First Element  First the Crown must establish that Kelly was acting, and knew he was acting, as an agent for the clients of his company KPA.  There can be no doubt in this case that an agency relationship existed between Kelly and his  clients and that Kelly was aware of the existence of that relationship.  Indeed this element of the offence was not an issue on this appeal or at the trial.  (b)Accepting a Benefit to Influence One's Principal ‑‑ The Second Element  The second element the Crown must prove is that the agent took the benefit as consideration for acting in relation to the affairs of the agent's principal.  There can be no doubt that Kelly accepted a commission from a third party.  It goes without saying that this commission comes within the category of a \"reward, advantage, or benefit\" required by s. 426.  Nor can there be any question that the commissions were accepted as consideration for doing an act in relation to the affairs of the principals.  Clearly, Kelly accepted the payment for recommending and eventually selling the MURBs to his clients.  To establish the requisitemens reafor this second element, the Crown must prove that the taker, knowingly accepted the commission as consideration for acting in relation to the affairs of his clients or principals. It must be remembered that offences involving \"secret commissions\" are by their very nature secretive.  They arise from operations that are inherently covert.  It follows that courts should in these cases apply common sense and draw the reasonable and appropriate inferences from the proven facts.  Certainly Qualico's purpose in paying commissions to Kelly would be to encourage Kelly to influence his clients to purchase Qualico MURBs.  Here it was Kelly who sought out Qualico to negotiate an agreement for selling MURBs and for receiving commissions on those sales.  It was Kelly who advised the resident manager of Qualico that he had \"good solid\" clients to whom he could sell the MURBs.  On the first development, Kelly was prepared to incur the risks of a performance bond with a strict time limit as part of the agreement for selling the entire development.  The only time that Kelly advised any of his clients to purchase MURBs was when the Qualico developments were put on the market.  Thus, it is clear from the inherent nature of commissions and from Kelly's actions that Kelly knowingly accepted the Qualico payments as consideration for influencing his principals (that is to say his clients) to purchase MURBs.  He was eminently successful in doing just that.

C-34 (now s. 207(3)).  In particular, they were accused of counselling the breaking of the so-called 15%-20% rule (a maximum of 15% of the revenues can go to management costs and a minimum of 20% of the revenues must go to the charity).  The terms and conditions for such lotteries are set out in Order-in-Council 2797/82 and other rules, regulations and directions issued by the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations of Ontario.  The allegation was that the substantive offence of breaching the terms and conditions of the licences was an offence under s. 190(3) of theCodeand that, therefore, s. 22 applied (counselling an offence).  The appellants challenged the provisions of ss. 190(1)(b) and 190(2) (now ss. 207(1)(b) and 207(2)). They submitted that Parliament exceeded its powers of delegation in permitting exemptions from criminality for charitable or religious organizations operating a lottery pursuant to a licence issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province.  They further argued that, even if there were a proper delegation of power to the provincial authority, Order-in-Council  2797/82 was not passed in accordance with provincial legislation and that the order, together with the other rules and directions, were not published and, therefore, did not create an offence known to law.  Finally, they contended that the legislative scheme set out in ss. 190(1)(b) and 190(2) violateds. 15of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsby reason of the unequal effect of those provisions throughout the country.  The trial judge, finding that the provisions of theCodepurporting to delegate power to the Lieutenant Governor in Council wereultra viresParliament as an improper delegation of criminal law, dismissed the charges against the appellants.  The Crown appealed the summary conviction acquittals to the Supreme Court of Ontario (Weekly Court).  Campbell J., allowing the appeal, set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial for the appellants: (1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 261, 66 C.R. (3d) 121.  The appellants' appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed: (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 467, 73 C.R. (3d) 242. ",

The majority of the Appeal Division concluded that the charge could not have confused the jury on the issue of the requisite intent for first and second degree murder.  It also rejected the argument that the judge's reference to criminal negligence in the charge required a new trial.  While the reference was unnecessary, the majority was satisfied that reading the charge as a whole, the jury could not have been confused on the essential issues -- provocation and drunkenness.  Additional objections, including those relating to the trial judge's treatment of provocation and his instructions on weighing evidence and assessing credibility, were held to be without merit.  Jones J.A. concluded (at p. 113):",
            "With respect to the trial judge's instructions on murder, Macdonald J.A. stated that, in his view, the charge could have given the jury the mistaken impression that criminal negligence would support a charge of murder and thus was erroneous.  As to provocation, Macdonald J.A. also was of the view that the trial judge at one point misdirected the jury as to what provocation means in law.  Concluding, however, that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the misdirection on provocation, since the trial judge told the jury that in his view provocation did exist, Macdonald J.A. applied the curative provision of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , with respect to that error.  As to the first error in the charge, Macdonald J.A. stated that he was not convinced that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the error had not occurred and thus did not invoke s. 686(1)(b)(iii) with respect to the criminal negligence reference."

        "Facts": " On June 13, 1988, Norman Smith, a fisherman, killed his friend, Larry Goreham, with a shotgun.  Smith and Goreham had been drinking with two other men, Earl Hopkins and Ronald Hines, in Goreham's barn.  After several hours of drinking an argument erupted between Smith and Hopkins, apparently over their respective abilities as fishermen.  The fight became physical.  While there is some dispute about exactly what happened, there is no doubt that Smith was beaten quite badly as a result of the altercation.  According to Hines, he left the barn pointing his finger at the other men and saying: \"I'll get you all.\"  Smith denies this.  Smith returned ten to fifteen minutes later with his loaded 12-gauge shotgun.  Upon hearing Smith's vehicle, Hopkins looked out the window to see Smith holding the gun.  Smith fired, shattering a barn window.  Hopkins ducked out of the way.  Goreham was less wise; appearing at the upper doors of the barn, he began taunting Smith.  Smith fired.  The shot struck Goreham on the face and chest, and he fell back and died.  Investigation established that the gun was fired at a distance of about 96 feet and that there were 169 pellet holes in Goreham's body.  Smith got in his vehicle and went home.  Substituting a rifle and ammunition for his shotgun, he proceeded to his sister's residence, where he spent the night.  Early the next morning he telephoned the police, and at 6:00 a.m. the police came to arrest him.  When Smith walked out of the house to surrender, he was met by three officers covering him with rifles; he was directed to his knees, handcuffed and placed in the rear of a police vehicle.  In the police vehicle, Constable Terry Faye advised Smith that he was under arrest \"for a shooting incident at the residence of Larry Goreham\".  Constable Faye then instructed Smith that \"[you have] the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay\".  The officer asked Smith if he understood what that meant and he replied: \"It means I can get a lawyer doesn't it?\"  The officer answered: \"Yes, it does\".  Constable Faye then provided Smith with the standard police warning and asked him if he understood the warning.  Smith replied: \"I can tell you fellas what went on or I don't have to\".  The officer then advised Smith to say nothing until they reached the police station.  Smith arrived at the R.C.M.P. detachment in Barrington, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, at 6:25 a.m.  Once inside an interview room, Constable Faye stated: \"I just want to refresh your memory back there in the car about what I told you.  First of all, I told you you were under arrest and that you could contact a lawyer.  Lastly, I read you the police warning and you said that you understood that.  Norman, do you want the opportunity to exercise those rights about anything I have said to you so far?\"  Smith responded: \"No\".  The officer then said to Smith, \"O.K. Norman I'd like to get your side of the story.  We've heard the other side and I think it's only fair that we get your side.\"  Between 6:33 a.m. and 7:47 a.m. the police then took a statement from Smith, in which Smith admitted the shooting but sought to explain it on the grounds of drunkenness and provocation.  While the statement was being taken, Constable Faye was able to detect a very slight odour of alcohol on Smith's breath.  He also observed that Smith's left eye was almost completely swollen shut and that there was some bruising on his face.  During the interview, Constable Faye also became aware that Smith did not know that Mr. Goreham had died.  The police had only told Smith that he was being arrested for \"a shooting incident\".  Although the police knew that they were investigating a murder, at no time during the interrogation did they inform Smith of this fact.  Smith was not informed of Goreham's death until some time after 8:37 a.m., after Smith had finished his statement and had been fingerprinted, photographed and placed in a cell.  At that time, Constable Faye also told Smith that he would be discussing the matter with the Crown prosecutor but that Smith should \"think the worst\".  Smith was charged with first degree murder.  At trial, after avoir direat which the appellant testified, the appellant's statement was held to be admissible in evidence.  Smith also testified at trial in support of the defences of drunkenness and provocation.  In charging the jury, the trial judge provided instruction with respect to both the elements of first and second degree murder and the meaning of planning and deliberation.  Prior to defining murder, the trial judge also instructed the jury on the matter of criminal negligence and stated that pointing a loaded shotgun at someone while drunk is criminal negligence.  On the question of provocation, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they found that the appellant had the capacity to form the requisite intent, they could convict Smith for murder, subject to their consideration of the defence of provocation.  The jury returned with a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.

        "Facts": " In the absence of an objective of sufficient importance to justify overriding the right of free expression, the state's interest in suppressing expression which may potentially affect a public interest cannot outweigh the individual's constitutional right of freedom of expression and s. 181 cannot be upheld unders. 1of theCharter.  But even if one were to attribute to s. 181 an objective of promoting social and racial tolerance in society and manage the further leap of concluding that objective was so pressing and substantial as to be capable of overriding entrenched rights, the Crown's case unders. 1of theCharterwould fail for want of proportionality between the potential reach of s. 181 on the one hand, and the \"evil\" to which it is said to be directed on the other.  Assuming a rational link between the objective of social harmony ands. 181of theCriminal Code, the breadth of the section is such that it goes much further than necessary to achieve that aim.  Accepting that the legislative solution need not be \"perfect\", it nevertheless must be \"appropriately and carefully tailored in the context of the infringed right\":Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1138.  The effect of s. 181 is to inhibit the expression or publication of any statements which may be found by a jury to be factual, false and likely to cause injury or mischief to a public interest.  The territory covered by this prohibition can only be described as vast, as revealed by a brief look at the key phrases on which guilt or innocence turns.  The phrase \"statement, tale or news\", while it may not extend to the realm of true opinion (wherever the line is to be drawn, itself a question of great difficulty), obviously encompasses a broad range of historical and social speech, going well beyond what is patent or provable to the senses as a matter of \"pure fact\". Indeed, one of the cases relied upon in support of the proposition that the section deals only with statements of fact and not with expressions of opinion,R. v. Hoaglin,supra, demonstrates just how slippery the distinction may be. If the expression in issue in that case, in which a disaffected American settler in Alberta had printed posters which stated \"Americans not wanted in Canada; investigate before buying land or taking homesteads in this country\" is an example of a \"false statement of fact\" falling within the prohibition, one shudders to consider what other comments might be so construed. Nor are the difficulties confined to determining what is a factual assertion as opposed to an expression of opinion.  What is false may, as the case on appeal illustrates, be determined by reference to what is generally (or, as inHoaglin, officially) accepted as true, with the result that the knowledge of falsity required for guilt may be inferred from the impugned expression's divergence from prevailing or officially accepted beliefs.  This makes possible conviction for virtually any statement which does not accord with currently accepted \"truths\", and lends force to the argument that the section could be used (or abused) in a circular fashion essentially to permit the prosecution of unpopular ideas.  Particularly with regard to the historical fact -- historical opinion dichotomy, we cannot be mindful enough both of the evolving concept of history and of its manipulation in the past to promote and perpetuate certain messages.  The danger is not confined to totalitarian states like the Nazi regime in Germany or certain communist regimes of the past which blatantly rewrote history.  We in Canada need look no further than the `not so noble savage' portrayal of Native Canadians in our children's history text books in the early part of this century.  Similarly, in the United States, one finds the ongoing revision of the historical representation of African Americans, whose contribution to aspects of the history of the United States, such as their contribution to the North's victory in the Civil War, is only now being recognized.  But perhaps the greatest danger of s. 181 lies in the undefined and virtually unlimited reach of the phrase \"injury or mischief to a public interest\".  Neither the respondent nor its supporting interveners has proffered any case law in which this phrase has been applied to a given factual circumstance in a clear and consistent manner.  My colleagues refer to the \"serious harm\" and \"serious injury\" caused by deliberate falsehoods, but this begs the question of what sort or degree of harm is necessary in order to bring the section into play. Indeed, the limited jurisprudence on s. 181 evidences conflicting opinions on what constitutes a threatened or injured \"public interest\" justifying criminal sanction.  It is difficult to see how a broad, undefined phrase such as \"public interest\" can on its face constitute a restrained, appropriately limited measure which impairs the right infringed to the minimum degree consistent with securing the legislation's objectives.  Any deliberate lie (potentially defined as that which does not accord with accepted truth), which causes or is likely to cause \"injury\" or  \"mischief\" to any \"public interest\" is within the potential reach of the section.  The interpretation given to \"public interest\" in this case may not have been objectionable.  But that is not the issue in determining whether a legislative restriction of rights is overbroad.  The issue is whether the provision permits the state to restrict constitutional rights in circumstances and ways that may not be justifiable.  The vague and broad wording of s. 181 leaves open that possibility.  Cory and Iacobucci JJ. propose to overcome this difficulty by defining the phrase \"public interest\" in accordance with selectedChartervalues.  Two observations are relied upon -- that courts regularly define phrases in legislation, and that the courts have not, thus far, adequately defined \"public interest\" -- as the justification to define anew \"public interest\" in the context of s. 181's purported application to Mr. Zundel.  Although the section's \"legislative history\" and the \"legislative and social context in which it is used\" is said by my colleagues to govern the definitional process, their interpretation focuses upon a select range ofChartervalues, values which do not include freedom of expression.  In support of this technique, reliance is placed upon the following authorities:Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513;Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; andR. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654.  These authorities confirm the following basic propositions: that the common law should develop in accordance with the values of theCharter(Salituro,supra, at p. 675), and that where a legislative provision, on a reasonable interpretation of its history and on the plain reading of its text, is subject to two equally persuasive interpretations, the Court should adopt that interpretation which accords with theCharterand the values to which it gives expression (HillsandSlaight,supra).  None of these decisions stands for the proposition that an age-old provision whose aim and scope was created pre-Chartercan, as of 1982, be redefined by reference to a present-day perception of utility.  The result of my colleagues' redefinition is the equation of \"public interest\" with \"the protection and preservation of those rights and freedoms set out in theCharteras fundamental to Canadian society\" (p. 000). Thus, for example, whenever the Crown can establish that the publication of a false statement is likely seriously to injure the dignity and equality of those whomss. 15and27of theCharterare intended to protect, the offence is made out. In so doing my colleagues have arguably created a new offence, an offence hitherto unknown to the criminal law. The promotion of equality and multiculturalism is a laudable goal, but, with respect, I can see no basis in the history or language of s. 181 to suggest that it is the motivating goal behind its enactment or retention. To import it is to engage not in a valid process of statutory interpretation, but in impermissible reading in of content foreign to the enactment;Salituro,SlaightandHillswere never intended to be taken this far.  Section 181 can be used to inhibit statements which society considers should be inhibited, like those which denigrate vulnerable groups.  Its danger, however, lies in the fact that by its broad reach it criminalizes a vast penumbra of other statements merely because they might be thought to constitute a mischief to some public interest, however successive prosecutors and courts may wish to define these terms.  The danger is magnified because the prohibition affects not only those caught and prosecuted, but those who may refrain from saying what they would like to because of the fear that they will be caught.  Thus worthy minority groups or individuals may be inhibited from saying what they desire to say for fear that they might be prosecuted.  Should an activist be prevented from saying \"the rainforest of British Columbia is being destroyed\" because she fears criminal prosecution for spreading \"false news\" in the event that scientists conclude and a jury accepts that the statement is false and that it is likely to cause mischief to the British Columbia forest industry?  Should a concerned citizen fear prosecution for stating in the course of political debate that a nuclear power plant in her neighbourhood \"is destroying the health of the children living nearby\" for fear that scientific studies will later show that the injury was minimal?  Should a medical professional be precluded from describing an outbreak of meningitis as an epidemic for fear that a government or private organization will conclude and a jury accept that his statement is a deliberate assertion of a false fact?  Should a member of an ethnic minority whose brethren are being persecuted abroad be prevented from stating that the government has systematically ignored his compatriots' plight?  These examples suggest there is merit in the submission of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association that the overbreadth of s. 181 poses greater danger to minority interest groups worthy of popular support than it offers protection.  These examples illustrate s. 181's fatal flaw -- its overbreadth.  At pages 000-000, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. attempt to alleviate the fears associated with the problem of overbreadth by arguing that the Crown will always bear a heavy onus in proving all of the elements under s. 181.  It is argued that any danger is limited by the phrase \"public interest\" because even those publishing known falsehoods will not be prosecuted where their lies have an \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\".  In this way, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. claim that the examples proffered above raise no practical problem (see p. 000).  I, for one, find cold comfort in the assurance that a prosecutor's perception of \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\" affords adequate protection against undue impingement on the free expression of facts and opinions.  The whole purpose of enshrining rights in theCharteris to afford the individual protection against even the well-intentioned majority.  To justify an invasion of a constitutional right on the ground that public authorities can be trusted not to violate it unduly is to undermine the very premise upon which theCharteris predicated.  Cory and Iacobucci JJ. make no mention of the reality that the decision to prosecute must, by necessity, be made by state agents and that the issue must be adjudicated upon by a judge and jury in a particular locale with a particular conception of a benefit to the public.  All it takes is one judge and twelve jurors who believe that certain `falsehoods' compromise a particular \"public\" interest, and that such falsehoods `must have been' known to the accused, in order to convict.  A jury in Port Alberni, B.C., may have a very different view of the overall beneficial impact of false statements of fact impugning the lumber industry than a jury in Toronto.  Finally, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. fail to address the argument that the danger raised by these examples, the `chilling effect' of  s. 181, outweighs its minimal benefit given the alternative means of prosecution of speech detrimental to racial tolerance unders. 319of theCriminal Code.  Not only is s. 181 broad in contextual reach; it is particularly invasive because it chooses the most draconian of sanctions to effect its ends -- prosecution for an indictable offence under the criminal law.  Our law is premised on the view that only serious misconduct deserves criminal sanction.  Lesser wrongs are left to summary conviction and the civil law.  Lies, for the most part, have historically been left to the civil law of libel and slander; it has been the law of tort or delict that has assumed the main task of preserving harmony and justice between individuals and groups where words are concerned.  This is not to say that words cannot properly be constrained by the force of the criminal law.  But the harm addressed must be clear and pressing and the crime sufficiently circumscribed so as not to inhibit unduly expression which does not require that the ultimate sanction of the criminal law be brought to bear:  see Dickson C.J. inKeegstra,supra, at p. 772.   TheCriminal Codeprovisions against hatemongering met that criterion, focusing as they did on statements intended to cause \"hatred against any identifiable group\".  The broad, undefined term \"mischief to a public interest\", on the other hand, is capable of almost infinite extension.

            "McLachlin J. -- This case raises the issue of the proper limits of appellate jurisdiction to overturn a conviction under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  It also raises the question of the approach which should be taken to the evidence of children.",
            "The function of the Court of Appeal, under s. 613(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence to support a conviction.  The Court must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.  While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the Court must re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.  This process will be the same whether the case is based on circumstantial or direct evidence.  In the Court of Appeal, the majority clearly found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the verdict and both Macdonald and Craig JJ.A. rejected all rational inferences offering an alternative to the conclusion of guilt.  It is therefore clear that the law was correctly understood and applied.",
            "Before turning to the particular errors alleged, I pause to consider the general question of how courts should approach the evidence of young children.  The law affecting the evidence of children has undergone two major changes in recent years.  The first is removal of the notion, found at common law and codified in legislation, that the evidence of children was inherently unreliable and therefore to be treated with special caution. Thus, for example, the requirement that a child's evidence be corroborated has been removed: s. 586 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, which prohibited the conviction of a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a child testifying unsworn, was repealed by An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act, S.C. 1987, c. 24, s. 15, effective January 1, 1988. Similar provisions of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, and Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 110, have also been eliminated. The repeal of provisions creating a legal requirement that children's evidence be corroborated does not prevent the judge or jury from treating a child’s evidence with caution where such caution is merited in the circumstances of the case.  But it does revoke the assumption formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children’s evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults.  So if a court proceeds to discount a child’s evidence automatically, without regard to the circumstances of the particular case, it will have fallen into an error.",
            "As Wilson J. emphasized in B. (G.), these changes in the way the courts look at the evidence of children do not mean that the evidence of children should not be subject to the same standard of proof as the evidence of adult witnesses in criminal cases.  Protecting the liberty of the accused and guarding against the injustice of the conviction of an innocent person require a solid foundation for a verdict of guilt, whether the complainant be an adult or a child.  What the changes do mean is that we approach the evidence of children not from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on what Wilson J. called a \"common sense\" basis, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the evidence offered in the particular case.",
            "Placing myself, as I must, in the position of the Court of Appeal (see Criminal Code  s. 695 , and the comments of McIntyre J. in Yebes, supra, at p. 186), I conclude that we are here concerned with verdicts which \"a properly instructed jury [or judge], acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered\", to repeat the words of Yebes.  I would allow the appeal and restore the convictions."

        "Facts": " The respondent was convicted on three counts of indecent assault, one count of gross indecency and one count of sexual assault against three young girls, B.W., M.W. and S.W.  Without going into the rather complex details of the family relationship, it may be simply stated that the respondent lived with and assumed a quasi-paternal role vis-à-vis the three girls, being the uncle of B.W. and having been married to the mother of S.W. and M.W.  The first three charges (two of indecent assault and one of gross indecency) concerned B.W.  She was between two and four years old when the incidents occurred in 1981-82, seven years old when the offences were reported to the authorities, and nine years old at the time of trial.  The fourth charge (of sexual assault) concerned M.W.  She was between nine and ten at the time of the events in question, eleven when the offences were reported, and twelve at the time of trial.  The fifth charge (of indecent assault) concerned S.W.  She was ten years old at the time of the events in question, fourteen at the time of reporting, and sixteen at the time of trial.  The substance of the charges is as follows.  B.W. alleged that while she was living with the respondent and his wife (her uncle and aunt) in the red brick house in Napanee, the respondent would come and take her from her bed, which she shared with S.W. and M.W., and lead her upstairs to his bedroom, where he would take down her pants, drop his pyjamas, and rub his soft penis over her vagina.  B.W. stated in evidence that this happened two or three times a week.  On one occasion, the respondent asked B.W. to suck on his \"dink\", which she did (this incident is the basis of the gross indecency charge).  B.W. also described a further incident which occurred on a camping trip, when the respondent took her into the family's van, laid her on the floor, and rubbed his penis over her vagina.  S.W. described two incidents in the red brick house in Napanee.  S.W. and the respondent were fully clothed throughout both incidents.  The first incident began as play-wrestling, but the respondent began to breathe heavily and rubbed his erect penis against her buttocks.  In the second incident, the respondent lay down beside her in bed, and she could feel his erect penis against her buttocks.  M.W. described three incidents involving the respondent.  Both M.W. and the respondent were fully clothed throughout all three incidents.  In the first incident, she was sitting on the respondent's lap while he combed her hair and rubbed his erect penis against her lower back.  In the second and third incidents, the respondent rolled M.W. onto the floor, forced her legs apart and rubbed his penis against her vagina.  The respondent testified in his own defence. He admitted to wrestling with M.W. and S.W., and to brushing the girls' hair, but denied all the allegations that formed the basis of the charges against him. Aside from the respondent's denial, the evidence of the oldest child, S.W., was uncontradicted and internally consistent. The evidence of the two younger children, however, quite apart from the respondent's denial, revealed a number of inconsistencies and was contradicted in some respects. ",

        "Facts": " On January 22, 1988 the Alberta Labour Relations Board declared that the appellant union, the United Nurses of Alberta, had failed to comply with s. 105(3) of the AlbertaLabour Relations Act(as amended by S.A. 1983, c. 34) by threatening to strike or cause a strike prohibited by the Act.  The Board also issued a directive pursuant to s. 142(5) of the Act ordering that the union cease and desist from causing a strike or threatening to strike, that it refrain from conducting a strike vote, and that the union and its officers notify the members of the union of the directive and their obligation to comply.  On that same day the members of the union voted to strike, and the following day the union gave notice to the employer of most of the union members, the Alberta Hospital Association (AHA), that it would commence strike action on Monday, January 25, 1988.  On Sunday, January 24, the Board declared that the union had breached the directive of January 22, again declared that the union had breached s. 105(3) of theLabour Relations Act, and specifically declared that the strike scheduled to commence on Monday morning was illegal.  The union was again directed to cease threatening strike action, and was specifically directed not to strike on Monday, January 25.  This directive also gave notice to the union that the directives would be filed as an order of the Court of Queen's Bench.  The first directive was so filed, pursuant to s. 142(7) of the Act, on January 24, the day before the strike was scheduled to commence.  The second directive was filed with the court forthwith.  Thus, on January 25, two court orders forbad the union to strike.  The strike began as scheduled on January 25.  That afternoon a press conference was held at which approximately 30 members of the media were present.  While the president of the union, Margaret Ethier, indicated that the union was primarily concerned with achieving an appropriate settlement, she acknowledged the existence of \"the court orders that are coming at us now\", and when asked whether the union was breaking the laws of the province, answered \"Yes, that's correct.\"  When asked whether the possibility of an injunction meant anything, Ethier replied that the strike would be continuing \"until such time that a settlement is reached.\"  She indicated that she was aware that \"they now have [the cease and desist orders] filed with the court.\"  When questioned further about the illegality of the strike, she declined to agree that \"the law's an ass\", but continued to say that \"I've never looked too much to the law.  We've got a business to run; it's a private business dispute . . . .\"  On January 29 the Attorney General of Alberta filed a notice of motion seeking that the union be held in criminal contempt, and on February 3 the union was found guilty by Sinclair J. and a fine of $250,000 was levied.  A second press conference was held that day, and when the president of the union was asked whether the fact of a conviction would change the union's position in terms of staying off the job, she replied \"Well, as I said to you before we are prepared to go back any time we have an appropriate settlement and from the response of the AHA we don't have one.\"  On February 9 a second motion was filed alleging that the strike was continuing, and that the union continued to be in criminal contempt.  On February 18 the union was convicted of this second charge of criminal contempt by O'Byrne J. and fined $150,000.

        "Facts": " Basic fact presumptions can be further categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions.  A permissive presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact is drawn following proof of the basic fact.  A mandatory presumption requires that the inference be made.  Presumptions may also be either rebuttable or irrebuttable.  If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways the presumed fact can be rebutted.  First, the accused may be required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence.  Secondly, the accused may have an evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the truth of the presumed fact.  Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or a persuasive burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non-existence of the presumed fact.  Finally, presumptions are often referred to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact.  The latter entail \"frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence\" . . . while the former involve actual legal rules.  [Emphasis in original.]  A very useful analysis of presumptions that can be utilized in this case can be found in the writing of T. A. Cromwell in \"Proving Guilt: The Presumption of Innocence and theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" in W. H. Charles, T. A. Cromwell and K. B. Jobson, eds.,Evidence and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms(1989), 125, at pp. 130ff. (which in turn is based on the analysis favoured by Professor Cross inEvidence(5th ed. 1979), at pp. 122ff., approved inOakes).  The presumptions can be summarized in this way:  1)  Presumptions which operate without the requirement of proof of any basic facts.  2)  Presumptions which require proof of a basic fact.  (a)  Permissive Inferences:  Where the trier of fact is entitled to infer a presumed fact from the proof of the basic fact, but is not obliged to do so.  This results in a tactical burden whereby the accused may wish to call evidence in rebuttal, but is not required to do so.  (b)  Evidential Burdens:  Where the trier of fact is required to draw the conclusion from proof of the basic fact in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  This mandatory conclusion results in an evidential burden whereby the accused will need to call evidence, unless there is already evidence to the contrary in the Crown's case.  (c)  Legal Burdens:  Similar to the burden in (b) except that the presumed fact must be disproved on a balance of probabilities instead of by the mere raising of evidence to the contrary.  These are also referred to as \"reverse onus clauses\".  The nature of the right to be presumed innocent set out ins. 11(d)of theCharterwas first considered inDubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350.  There Lamer J. (as he then was) was concerned with the nature of the right in connection withs. 13which provides protection against self-incrimination.  In that case he stated (at p. 357):  Section 11(d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or by calling other evidence.  Thus there is implicit in the right to be presumed innocent an obligation on the Crown to make out a case for the accused to meet before a response can be called for from the accused.  InSchuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, this Court once again considered the presumption that had come before it inProudlock,supra.  Eventually the case turned upon whether an acquittal in the face of such a presumption constituted a question of law or a fact.  Nonetheless the decision is helpful in its qualification of the presumption.  It was held at p. 610 that:  But when the burden has been shifted (as is the case for proof of intent when a person is found in a place which he or she has broken into), it can be said, absent any evidence to the contrary, that there is no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could exist as regards the intent of the accused, and an appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a question of law alone.  In other words the presumption required the trier of fact to convict in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.  This presumption would come within category 2(b).  InR. v. Oakes,supra, the Court considered s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actwhich provided that if the Crown was able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been in possession of a narcotic, then the accused was to be \"given an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking\".  The section in effect required the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did not have possession of the narcotics for purposes of trafficking.  It was held that s. 11(d) required that an individual must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; that the State must bear the burden of proving this; and proof of guilt must be accomplished \"according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\".  Dickson C.J. applying this basic principle to the reverse onus provision contained in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actconcluded at pp. 132-33 that:  In general one must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption  of innocence in s. 11(d).  If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue.  The Chief Justice went on to note that even though a rational connection might exist between the established fact and the presumed fact this may not be sufficient to render the presumption constitutional.  On page 134 he stated:  A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.  An accused person could thereby be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt.  This would violate the presumption of innocence.  Contrary to the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dickson C.J. stressed that the rational connection between the proven and the presumed fact is better taken into account when analyzing the effect ofs. 1of theCharteron the impugned legislation, rather than in the process of determining whether s. 11(d) had been violated.  The principles set forth inOakeswere applied inR. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, wheres. 213(d) of theCriminal Codewas questioned.  The section provided that the offence of murder was committed if the accused used a weapon or had it on his person at the time he commits or attempts to commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence.  Thus a conviction of murder was possible although the accused had neither an objective nor subjective intent to kill the victim.  Lamer J. speaking for the majority of the Court concluded that the Crown was required to prove all elements of the offence together with those required to satisfys. 7of theCharter.  He found that any provision which created an offence which allowed for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringeds. 7and s. 11(d).  He wrote at pp. 654-55:  These essential elements include not only those set out by the legislature in the provision creating the offence but also those required bys. 7of theCharter.  Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringesss. 7and 11(d).  Clearly, this will occur where the provision requires the accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an essential element of the offence by requiring that he raise more than just a reasonable doubt.  It is for this reason that this Court struck down the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Act.. . .  Sections 7 and 11(d) will also be infringed where the statutory definition of the offence does not include an element which is required under s. 7.  He then cited the words of Dickson C.J. inOakes,supra, set out earlier and continued:  It is clear from this passage that what offends the presumption of innocence is the fact that an accused may be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential element of the offence, and I do not think that it matters whether this results from the existence of a reverse onus provision or from the elimination of the need to prove an essential element.  . . .  Finally, the legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute proof of a different element.  In my view, this will be constitutionally valid only if upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.  If the trier of fact may have a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes ss. 7 and 11(d).  InR. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, the accused was charged with having the care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired.  The accused was found in the driver's seat of an automobile, slumped over the steering wheel.  The keys were in the ignition but the engine was not running.  The Crown relied on the same presumption considered inAppleby,supra, which placed the burden on an accused found in the driver's seat of establishing the absence of an intention to enter the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion.  The presumption was challenged and it was found that it did in fact infringe s. 11(d).  It was held that the word \"establishes\" required proof on a balance of probabilities.  The Crown argued that the section only required proof of an excuse rather than a disproof of any essential element of the offence.  That argument was not accepted.  Dickson C.J. for the Court stated at p. 18:  The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the presumption of innocence.  He then continued:  If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused.  . . .  In the passage fromVaillancourtquoted earlier, Lamer J. recognized that in some cases substituting proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if, upon proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.  This is another way of saying that a statutory presumption infringes the presumption of innocence if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt.  Only if the existence of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element exists, with no other reasonable possibilities, will the statutory presumption be constitutionally valid.  It was held that the presumption in that section did not have that required \"inexorable\" character and thus failed the test proposed inOakesandVaillancourt.  InR. v. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 59, the validity of a conviction based solely on the doctrine of recent possession was questioned.  McIntyre J. held that the provision created no more than a permissive presumption from which the trier of fact may, but not must, draw an inference of guilt of theft from the possession of recently stolen property.  He put his position in this way at pp. 71-72:  . . . where an explanation is offered for such possession which could reasonably be true, no inference of guilt on the basis of recent possession alone may be drawn, even where the trier of fact is not satisfied of the truth of the explanation.  The burden of proof of guilt remains upon the Crown, and to obtain a conviction in the face of such an explanation it must establish by other evidence the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  InR. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, the presumption of innocence was again considered.  The appellant was charged under a section which provided for relief from conviction if it could be established \"that the statements communicated were true\".  Once again the section was challenged as contravening s. 11(d).  Dickson C.J. confirmed that the presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  He reviewed the reasons inWhyte,supra, and then put forward his position in these words (at p. 790):  As is evident from the above quotation, the categorization of a factual finding as forming an element \"essential\" to the offence is of no consequence when determining whether s. 11(d) has been breached.  Applying the approach taken inWhyteto this appeal, it is obvious that s. 319(3)(a) runs afoul of the presumption of innocence.  Contrary to the arguments of those who would find s. 319(3)(a) compatible with s. 11(d), it matters not that the defence of truth may be intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction.  What is of essence is not the \"essential nature\" of the crime, but that the trier of fact will have to convict even where there is a reasonable doubt as to the truth of an accused's statements.  Perhaps it may be helpful to summarize the principles to be derived from the authorities.  I - The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  II - If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d).  Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.  III - Even if a rational connection exists between the established fact and the fact to be presumed, this would be insufficient to make valid a presumption requiring the accused to disprove an element of the offence.  IV - Legislation which substitutes proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if as a result of the proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the other element.  To put it another way, the statutory presumption will be valid if the proof of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the proof of the other.  However, the statutory presumption will infringe s. 11(d) if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt.  V - A permissive assumption from which a trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt will not infringe s. 11(d).  VI - A provision that might have been intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction will nonetheless contravene theCharterif the provision (such as the truth of a statement) must be established by the accused (seeKeegstra,supra).  VII - It must of course be remembered that statutory presumptions which infringe s. 11(d) may still be justified pursuant tos. 1of theCharter.  (As for example inKeegstra,supra.)  It is now necessary to apply these principles to the presumption set out in s. 195(2) to determine whether it contraveness. 11(d)of theCharter.  Application of the Principles Pertaining to Section 11(d) to the \"Living on Avails\" Provision  The presumption contained in s. 195 infringess. 11(d)of theChartersince it can result in the conviction of an accused despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  For example consider the situation of a spouse or companion of a prostitute, who is working, self-supporting and not dependent or relying upon the income garnered by the spouse or companion from prostitution.  There is nothing parasitical about such a relationship.  Neither being a prostitute nor being a spouse of a prostitute constitutes a crime.  Yet as a result of the presumption, the spouse could be found guilty despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  The fact that someone lives with a prostitute does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the person is living on avails.  The presumption therefore infringes s. 11(d).

C-46 .  Consequently, the only issue which is properly before this Court is the question of law upon which Tourigny J.A. dissented in the Court of Appeal.  The point of dissent in the Court of Appeal was whether the existence of an element of care and management is necessary to ground a conviction for keeping a common bawdy-house, contrary to s. 210(1) of the Code.  I agree with the reasons of Fish J.A., and respectfully disagree with the dissenting reasons of Tourigny J.A., to the extent that I have concluded that mere participation in the \"illicit\" activities of a common bawdy-house is not sufficient to ground a conviction for keeping a common bawdy-house.",

Pierce and Golloher (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 388 (Ont. C.A.), does not \"keep\" the place as a common bawdy-house. If that person is not guilty of a related offence, such as the commission of an indecent act in a public place (s. 173(1)(a)), his or her conduct is not proscribed by the Criminal Code .",

        "Facts": " The appellant was a Calgary lawyer charged with appropriating certain financial instruments from a client, one Jack Abrams.  The indictment charged thirteen counts of criminal breach of trust contrary to s. 296 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 336), thirteen counts of theft contrary to s. 294(a) (now s. 334(a)) of theCode, and one count of fraud contrary to s. 338(1)(a) (now s. 380(1)(a)) of theCode.  The trial in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench was before Brennan J. without a jury.  The Crown alleged that the appellant had wrongfully appropriated property which he held in trust for Abrams.  The defence did not contest the receipt of funds by the appellant.  The defence did contend, however, that despite Stinchcombe's formal status as trustee of the property, Abrams had in fact made Stinchcombe his business partner.  Under this theory, Stinchcombe had acted as he was legally entitled to act.  At issue therefore was the actual, as opposed to the formal, nature of the relationship between the two men.  Patricia Lineham is a former secretary of Mr. Stinchcombe.  She was a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry.  There, she gave evidence which was, apparently, very favourable to the defence regarding the conduct of Abrams.  The precise content of this testimony was not before the trial judge and is not in the record.  Lineham was not listed on the indictment, but was subpoenaed by the Crown.  After the preliminary inquiry but prior to the trial, Lineham was interviewed by an RCMP officer.  A tape-recorded statement was taken.  Crown counsel informed defence counsel of the existence but not the content of this statement.  A request for disclosure was refused.  Later, during the course of the trial, Lineham was again interviewed by a police officer and a written statement taken.  Again, though defence counsel was advised of the existence of the statement, a request for disclosure was refused.  Crown counsel also indicated that he would not be calling Lineham as she was not worthy of credit.  It was not until the third day of the trial that defence counsel learned conclusively that Lineham would not be called by the Crown.  At this time, he moved before the trial judge for an order that (i) the Crown call the witness, or (ii) the Court call the witness, or (iii) the Crown disclose the contents of the statements to the defence.  A review of the record makes it clear that defence counsel was pressing for access to, or production of, both the tape-recorded and written statements and was not pressing the alternative requests.  In support of this motion, counsel for the defendant indicated that Ms. Lineham refused to speak to him or his staff when they attempted to interview her about the contents of the statements.  Crown counsel did not provide any basis for resisting production other than to say that in his view the potential witness was not worthy of credit.  The trial judge dismissed the application.  Brennan J. ruled that under the circumstances there was no obligation on the Crown to call the witness and that there was no obligation on the Crown to disclose the contents of the statements.  The trial proceeded, and the accused was found guilty of all twenty-seven counts charged.  A conditional stay was entered with respect to the thirteen theft counts.  The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from conviction without issuing reasons.  Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the disclosure issue.  During argument before this Court, an application was made by the Crown to adduce the statements and the tape as fresh evidence.  This application was rejected.  The principal basis for the rejection was that at this stage it would be impossible to determine whether the statements would have been material to the defence if produced at trial.

        "Facts": " On January 12, 1989, the appellant sold one gram of hashish to an undercover police officer near the Granville Mall area of Vancouver. The parties do not dispute the facts surrounding the sale, which are as follows.  The undercover officer was involved in a \"buy-and-bust\" operation conducted by the Vancouver Police Department.  In a buy-and-bust operation, undercover police officers attempt to buy illicit drugs from individuals who appear, in the opinion of the officers, to be inclined to sell such drugs.  If an officer is successful, the individual is immediately arrested for trafficking.  This particular operation was undertaken by the Department with respect to the Granville Mall area in the city of Vancouver, which covers a six-block section of Granville Street.  On the day of the arrest, the undercover officer approached the accused, Philip Barnes, and his friend, as they were walking towards Granville Street.  The officer testified at trial that she approached the accused and his friend because she had \"a hunch, a feeling that they'd -- possibly might be in possession\".  She believed that he and his friend fit the description of persons who possibly had drugs in their possession and who would be willing to sell to her: \"I had a feeling. They fit my general criteria.  I look for males hanging around, dressed scruffy and in jeans, wearing a jean jacket or leather jacket, runners or black boots, that tend to look at people a lot.\"  The officer indicated that there was nothing else that aroused her suspicions.  The officer approached the accused and asked him if he had any \"weed\".  He said \"no\", but his friend repeated to him: \"She wants some weed.\"  The accused again responded negatively.  The officer persisted and the accused then agreed to sell a small amount of cannabis resin to the officer for $15.  Shortly afterwards, the accused was arrested by another officer and small amounts of cannabis resin and marijuana were seized from his person.  The accused was tried in the County Court of Vancouver before Leggatt Co. Ct. J., and was found guilty of trafficking in cannabis resin, of the included offence of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and of possession of marijuana.  The accused conceded that he sold illicit drugs to the officer, but argued that a judicial stay for entrapment should be directed.  He claimed that he had no intention of selling drugs on the day in question, but felt sorry for the undercover officer; he agreed to sell only because he believed that his friend wanted to meet a woman and that this was a way of gaining an introduction.  The trial judge held that the police officer had engaged in \"random virtue testing\", which was unacceptable according to the judgment of this Court inMack, supra, and therefore ordered a judicial stay of the proceedings.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial. ",

        "Facts": " The appellant, Mr. Pasquale Salituro, signed the name of his wife, Mrs. Carrie Salituro, on a cheque payable jointly to her and to him.  It was admitted that the appellant signed Mrs. Salituro's name and that he cashed the cheque, but the appellant's defence was that he had his wife's authority to do so.  Mrs. Salituro denied this and the trial judge accepted her evidence over the appellant's and convicted him of forgery.  The trial judge concluded on the basis of the appellant's testimony that the appellant and his wife were separated without any reasonable possibility of reconciliation at the time the appellant forged his wife's signature.  Without Mrs. Salituro's testimony the appellant would not have been convicted.  The issue is therefore whether Mrs. Salituro's testimony falls under an exception to the common law rule that a spouse is an incompetent witness for the prosecution.  Since this is an appeal as of right, the appeal is limited bys. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged with mischief to property contrary to s. 387(3) (now s. 430(3)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  In attempting to establish this offence, the Crown sought to introduce evidence of the whereabouts of the appellant obtained through the use of an electronic tracking device (a \"beeper\") installed in his car.  A beeper may be described as a radio transmitter, usually battery operated, which emits periodic signals that can be picked up by a radio receiver.  The background and manner of installation may briefly be summarized as follows.  The appellant had for some time been under surveillance by the Ontario Provincial Police (the O.P.P.) who suspected him of involvement in a recent murder in Morewood, Ontario which they believed to be linked to a series of similar killings in the area.  In the course of its homicide investigation, the O.P.P. on July 14, 1987 applied for a warrant to search the appellant's home and vehicle on the following grounds:  that the police had spotted the appellant driving his automobile towards his home shortly after the murder; that they had observed, in the back seat of his car, a pair of binoculars, a pair of work gloves, and a plastic rain coat, which appeared used; that they had observed under the car soil and vegetation (Timothy, a plant common to the area) similar to that found on the victim's property; that the appellant's voice sounded similar to that on a tape of someone who purported to be the murderer, though the voice appeared disguised and could not be positively identified; that the appellant had been a suspect in certain of the previous homicides; and that he had an extensive criminal record for break and enter, robbery, theft, and offences relating to offensive weapons.  The police obtained the warrant and conducted the search but found nothing in either the accused's home or vehicle to link him to any of the homicides.  Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, the police had towed the appellant's automobile to the police station to carry out the search.  Some time later, more than thirty hours after the expiration of the warrant, they installed an electronic tracking device in the interior of the appellant's vehicle.  The \"beeper\" was surreptitiously hidden in the foam in the back seat of the appellant's car, causing minor damage to the seat.  This, the trial judge held, was done on the basis of \"mere suspicion\" and it was, of course, done without judicial authorization.  The car was then returned to the appellant.  The beeper emitted a radio frequency transmission which could be detected by a police scanner for a distance of up to three kilometres.  Though the device was rather unsophisticated, and the person who installed it thought it was capable of giving only its general location, he had not counted on the ingenuity of the police who by listening to the tone and using an antenna held outside the window of a police vehicle could be led in a specific direction.  Along with constant visual surveillance, the device enabled the police to track the appellant's whereabouts at all times of the day or night.  The trial judge found that the police used the device on a constant basis for a period extending over many months, and pertinently, over a month prior to the commission of the offence alleged in the present case, both to track the vehicle in motion and to pinpoint its location when stationary.  On August 15, 1987, the day of the alleged offence, the police had lost visual contact with the appellant's vehicle but were able to trace its location using the beeper.  Upon moving to that location, the police established surveillance on a vehicle resembling the appellant's that was parked in a driveway.  Approximately two hours later, the police surveillance team heard a loud noise which sounded like metal crashing.  The crashing sound was caused by the felling of a Bell Canada communications tower, the value of which was in excess of $2 million.  Soon after, the police observed another vehicle, which was in fact the appellant's and appeared to be identical to the one they were watching, pull out of a laneway in a nearby field from which the crashing sound had emanated.  The second vehicle was later located at the appellant's residence.  On August 26, 1987, the O.P.P. observed the appellant sitting in his car in a field, where he had parked in an attempt to avoid the heavy police surveillance.  At this time, the police conducted a warrantless search of the appellant's vehicle and person.  Nothing was found.  Later that evening, the police obtained a warrant to search the appellant's vehicle.  When the car was vacuumed, melted pieces of metal, consistent with the metal guy wires of the Bell communications tower, were discovered.  On November 13, 1987, the appellant was charged with mischief to property over $1,000 with respect to the Bell tower.  The appellant brought a pre-trial motion for exclusion of the evidence relating to his whereabouts on August 15, 1987 on the ground that such evidence had been obtained in violation of his rights unders. 8of theCharter.  The trial judge granted the appellant's motion and refused to admit any of the evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the use of the electronic tracking device.  As a result, he acquitted the appellant.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

            "The question of whether a theft occurred in this case is governed by s. 322(1)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which states:"
        ],
        "Facts": " Mr. Milne, through his company National Electronics Security Inc., supplied goods and services to the Hudson's Bay Co.  An account for $16,981 was paid by the Hudson's Bay Co., by sending the company a cheque in that amount which Mr. Milne deposited into his company's account.  A month later, due to an error by the Hudson's Bay Co., a second cheque for $16,981 was received and deposited by Mr. Milne into his company's account.  Mr. Milne then appropriated the money by writing company cheques in his own favour.  These cheques were certified by Mr. Milne, and reduced the balance of his company's account to practically nil.  Mr. Milne had sole signing authority for the company account.  A security officer for the Hudson's Bay Co. was unable to contact Mr. Milne concerning the mistaken payment, despite leaving repeated messages.  The question of whether a theft occurred in this case is governed bys. 322(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, which states:  322.(1)  Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent,  (a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;  (b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;  (c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or  (d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.  The trial judge concluded that Mr. Milne knew that the second cheque had been issued to his company by mistake, and given this knowledge, his actions in depositing it and then withdrawing the money constituted a conversion.  It seems to me that the only inference to be drawn from these circumstances is that [Mr. Milne] knew that the money received by the issuing of the second cheque had been paid in error, and that the funds should not have been deposited to this account.  In my view the actions of [Mr. Milne] who had knowledge of these circumstances in writing cheques on the numbered account which contained funds that should not have been in that account constituted theft.  Further, he held that Mr. Milne had performed this conversion fraudulently, and without colour of right, with the result that he was guilty of theft.  This decision was overturned by a majority of the Court of Appeal:  (1990), 77 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1, 109 A.R. 268, 59 C.C.C. (3d) 372, [1991] 1 W.W.R. 385 (hereinafter cited to Alta. L.R.).  Côté J.A. observed that whatever the intent of Mr. Milne, he could not commit theft if the Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain a property interest in the money it mistakenly paid to Mr. Milne's company.  He then examined the law of property with respect to payment under mistake and noted that in some cases such a payment transfers property, while in others it does not.  After analyzing the cases, Côté J.A. came to the view that whether property passes despite mistake depends on the kind of mistake which has been made.  If the mistake has to do with the object of the transfer, or its recipient, then property does not pass.  However, if the transferor gives the intended object to the intended recipient, property does pass, even if the intention itself was based on a mistake (at p. 20):  Property passes if, and only if, the transferor gives the very object he believes and intends to the very person he believes and intends.  That is so whether or not his willingness and decision to do so stem from fraud, forgetfulness, or spontaneous mistake, so long as the chattel and the recipients are the ones he intends.  But if he mixes up recipients, or mixes up property, and gets the wrong chattel or wrong recipient, no property passes.  That is so whatever caused his mistake, be it fraud or mishap.  Here the Hudson's Bay Co. intended to issue a cheque to National, and issued it just as intended with National as payee.  They intended to deliver it to National, and got it into the hands of National.  They intended National to negotiate it and keep the proceeds, and National did so.  The Hudson's Bay Co. did not confuse payees or property.  The Hudson's Bay Co. succeeded: they got the property intended into the hands of the intended recipient.  They knew, but forgot or overlooked, that they did not have to do so.  Property passed.  The Hudson's Bay Co. gained a civil cause of action for a like sum, but lost property in the cheque and its proceeds.  Neither [the respondent] nor his company National did anything to induce that payment.  Since in the present case, it was the intention of the Hudson's Bay Co. to transfer property in the proceeds of the second cheque to Mr. Milne, property did in fact pass.  The fact that this intention was based on the mistaken belief that the Hudson's Bay Co. owed Mr. Milne the money did not prevent the passing of money, though it created a civil cause of action for its return.  Côté J.A. noted that the nature and validity of the underlying contractual relationship were quite irrelevant to the question whether property passed through the second cheque (at p. 20):  And I agree that the test here is not whether there is operative mistake making void a contract.  (No one here suggests property was to pass or not pass by contract.  It was to pass or not pass by wording the payee of the cheque and by mere delivery.)  Having set out the civil law relating to property in this manner, Côté J.A. observed that it was not imperative that the civil law relating to property and the criminal law relating to theft should accord completely.  However, any other result would lead to anomalies.  Indeed, commercial practicality pointed in the same direction as the civil legal principles.  For instance, the ongoing web of payments between two companies is often complex and overpayments and allegation of overpayment are common.  Côté J.A. noted that if mistaken overpayment did not transfer property, a new kind of preference in bankruptcy would exist that had not been noticed before.  Côté J.A. also noted that the most commercially practical response to the receipt of a mistakenly paid cheque may often be to deposit it and then arrange for a refund cheque to be issued.  If property never passes in the first place, even this could amount to theft.  Côté J.A. rejected any application of trust principles or the law of conversion to this case (at p. 21):  In this case there is no question of a \"special property\".  On anyone's view, all property passed to National or none of it did.  Here there was no bailment, conditional sales contract, trust, or other split property, in the eyes of criminal law or civil law.  The Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain any property interest of any kind:Barclay's Bank v. Simms, supra.  Nothing turns here on conversion.  The doctrine extends the common law notion of what is a taking, and extends theft to cover those who already have possession.  It does nothing to change whether property passes or does not pass.  Nor does it affect who is the owner whose goods are taken or converted.  Finally, Côté J.A. noted that while Mr. Milne was certainly dishonest in his dealings with the second cheque, this particular form of dishonesty did not amount to theft, and could be dealt with in a number of other ways under theCriminal Code.  For these reasons, the majority in the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and set aside the conviction.  In dissent, McClung J.A. disagreed with the majority's conclusion that property in the proceeds of the second cheque had passed in law to Mr. Milne.  According to him, the law of unilateral mistake intervened on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Co. and avoided the transaction.  Because the Hudson's Bay Co. tendered the sum of $16,981 for services that had been paid for earlier, it was mistaken as to a fundamental term of the transaction, and this mistake was recognized by Mr. Milne.  \"On those facts the contract was not merely voidable, but void, and no rights could be created by it\" (p. 6).  Hence no title to the funds was passed.  McClung J.A. also held that a \"special property or interest\" in the funds pursuant to s. 322(1)(a) of theCodehad been retained by the Hudson's Bay Co.  According to him, such an interest may derive from the nature of the transaction between the payer and the recipient of the funds.  Applying those principles to the facts, he concluded that the funds had been entrusted to Mr. Milne, through his company, for the payment of the services earlier rendered.  These services had already been paid and were known to have been paid, and therefore, the proceeds of the cheque remained impressed with a trust, freezing a beneficial and special interest in the funds in the Hudson's Bay Co.

        "Facts": " The respondent Edwin Pearson was arrested in September 1989 and charged with five counts of trafficking in narcotics, contrary to s. 4 of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1.  A bail hearing was held shortly after his arrest.  Pearson was denied bail and ordered detained in custody until trial.  Shortly thereafter, a preliminary inquiry was held and Pearson was committed to trial.  At the end of the preliminary inquiry, Pearson brought an application to the preliminary inquiry judge unders. 523(2)(b) of theCriminal Codeto review the order that he remain in custody until trial.  The preliminary inquiry judge refused to review this order.  Pearson then brought an application forhabeas corpus.  He argued thats. 515(6)(d) of theCriminal Codeis unconstitutional, and that accordingly his detention was illegal.  Thehabeas corpusapplication was heard by Biron J. of the Quebec Superior Court on November 17, 1989.  At the outset of the hearing, the Attorney General of Canada obtained leave to intervene in the application and moved to dismiss the application on the ground that there was an alternative remedy, namely a review of the bail order unders. 520of theCriminal Code.  Biron J. granted this motion and dismissed Pearson's application.  Pearson appealed.  On September 10, 1990, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding thathabeas corpuswas an available remedy in the circumstances and thats. 515(6)(d) of theCriminal Codeviolatesss. 9,11(d)and11(e)of theCharter:  [1990] R.J.Q. 2438, 59 C.C.C.

On August 21, 1987, the City of Winnipeg Police entered the appellant's store with a search warrant and seized all the inventory.  The appellant was charged with 173 counts in the first indictment:  three counts of selling obscene material contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34 (now s. 163(2)(a)), 41 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a) (now s. 163(1)(a)) of theCriminal Code, 128 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Codeand one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code.  On October 19, 1987, the appellant reopened the store at the same location.  As a result of a police operation a search warrant was executed on October 29, 1987, resulting in the arrest of an employee, Norma McCord.  The appellant was arrested at a later date.  A joint indictment was laid against the appellant doing business as Avenue Video Boutique and Norma McCord.  The joint indictment contains 77 counts under s. 159 (now s. 163) of theCriminal Code:  two counts of selling obscene material contrary to s. 159(2)(a), 73 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a), one count of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 159(2)(a) and one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary to s. 159(2)(a).  The trial judge convicted the appellant on eight counts relating to eight films.  Convictions were entered against the co‑accused McCord with respect to two counts relating to two of the films.  Fines of $1,000 per offence were imposed on the appellant.  Acquittals were entered on the remaining charges.  The Crown appealed the 242 acquittals with respect to the appellant and the appellant cross‑appealed the convictions.  The majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and entered convictions for the appellant with respect to all of the counts, Twaddle and Helper JJ.A. dissenting.  Court of Queen's Bench(1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 97  Wright J. first considered whether the materials were obscene within the meaning ofs. 163(8)of theCriminal Code.  He noted that Canadian courts have interpreted the application of the \"community standards\" test to mean that as long as the trier of fact does not apply his or her subjective personal views but seeks objectively to ascertain the community standard, he or she may resolve that issue simply by drawing on his or her \"experience\".  Wright J. expressed serious difficulties in applying the community standards test, stating that to render a factual decision on the basis of experience is contrary to the judicial role and that he regards his own views drawn from his \"experience\" to be unreliable.  However, Wright J. was able to conclude on the basis of previous case law that the materials in question were obscene (at p. 113):  In the context of my own inability to confidently draw on my experience, and my belief, in any event, that it is incongruous and inconsistent with basic judicial legal principles to do so, normally I would be inclined to hold that the requisite community standard of tolerance has not been proved as an essential ingredient of the Crown's case and all the charges should be dismissed.  However, it is clear, from a review of the case‑law binding on me that independent of the manner in which a trial judge is directed to measure obscenity, material of the kind before the court has been well established as obscene and must continue to be regarded as obscene within theCriminal Codedefinition.  Applying the Canadian decisions on obscenity since the inclusion of s. 163 in theCriminal Code, Wright J. found that there was no doubt that the videos and magazines in the present case fall into the category of \"hard porn\" and that the sexual devices are similar to the kind of sexual paraphernalia held by this Court inDechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, andGermain v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 241, to fall under the obscenity definition.  Accordingly, he found that all of the materials referred to in the various charges in the indictments are obscene according to the case law interpretation of s. 163(8).  Wright J. then concluded that the obscene material was protected bys. 2(b)of theCharter.  Following the principles inIrwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, he noted that obscene expression reflected in the material certainly conveys meaning and is entitled to protection provided the form of expression is not violent.  In conducting the s. 1 analysis, Wright J. was of the view that legislation which seeks to proscribe a fundamental freedom must have as its objective a more precise purpose than simply to control the morals of society or to encourage decency.  He wrote, at p. 121:  The aim must be directed more specifically to objectives such as equality concerns, or otherCharterrights, or particular human rights; otherwise, the basic freedoms in theCharterwill be subject to restrictions that arise from very personal and subjective opinions of right and wrong that will be impossible to identify . . . .  Examples of more precise aims or bases for restrictions will be:  (1)The protection of people from involuntary exposure to pornographic material;  (2)the protection of the vulnerable, for example children, from either exposure or participation;  (3)the prevention of the circulation of pornographic material that effectively reduces the human or equality or otherCharterrights of individuals.  This may arise, and often will arise, in material that mixes sex with violence or cruelty, or otherwise dehumanizes women or men.  Applying these standards, he concluded that on aprima faciebasis, only those materials which contained scenes involving violence or cruelty intermingled with sexual activity or depicted lack of consent to sexual contact or otherwise could be said to dehumanize men or women in a sexual context were legitimately proscribed under s. 1.  With respect to the material and sexual devices covered by the remaining counts he said, at pp. 124-25:  The material covered by the remaining counts in the indictments, relating to the magazines and the videos, reflects consensual activity by adult individuals not involving force, duress or cruelty.  In this context, I am unable to conclude that the depiction of the human body or any of its parts, no matter how explicitly presented, or the visual presentation of masturbation, group sex or other heterosexual or homosexual activity, including incestuous relations,prima facierelate to sufficiently specific concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society to justify restricting or limiting the basic freedom permitting them to be expressed.  The same reasoning applies in respect of the material before the court described as sexual toys or devices.  The Crown has failed to bring forward cogent and persuasive evidence to demonstrate the specific objectives sought to be achieved, and to show that such objectives justify the limits on freedom of expression which the impugned legislation seeks to bring about.

        "Facts": " As no trial has yet been held in this matter, the facts have been taken from the evidence at the preliminary inquiry.  The transcript of the preliminary inquiry was filed with the Court of Appeal and with this Court as the factual basis for the appeals.  On December 31, 1987, Teresa Santos attended a New Year's Eve party in Toronto.  Shortly after midnight, a fight broke out at the party.  As she was attempting to gather her belongings, which were located at a table in the vicinity of the fight, Ms. Santos was struck on the arm by a piece of glass.  The glass fragment produced a large gash on her left forearm which required seven stitches to mend the underlying pronator muscle in her arm and a further seven stitches to mend the skin above the muscle.  Eight months later, the feeling and movement in the victim's forearm was still restricted.  The victim's husband, Fernando Santos, was standing near his wife while the fight was in progress.  He noticed that the appellant and a number of others were involved in the altercation.  The appellant and the Santos were standing approximately eight feet away from a wall on opposite sides of the same table.  Some of the men who were fighting began throwing bottles.  Mr. Santos then noticed the appellant throw a bottle which hit the wall beside Ms. Santos and shattered.  A piece of glass from the bottle thrown by the appellant ricocheted off the wall and struck the victim on the arm causing her injury.  As a result of this incident, the appellant was charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm contrary to s. 245.3  of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 269).  He was committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry held on October 31, 1988.  At the outset of the trial and before any evidence was heard, the accused made a motion to have s. 269 declared of no force or effect on the ground that it contraveneds. 7of theCharter.  The motion was granted and the indictment was quashed.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the motion judgment was overturned and the order quashing the indictment was set aside.  This appeal comes before the Court as of right.

        "Facts": " The appellant, Robert Théroux, was a businessman involved in residential construction in the province of Quebec.  He operated through a company called Les Habitations Co‑Hab Inc.  Although a personal bankruptcy prevented him from serving as a director of Co‑Hab, Théroux was the directing mind, orâme dirigeante, of the company.  The charges arise out of two residential housing projects Co‑Hab undertook through its subsidiaries, one in Laprairie and one in St‑Catherine.  Sales to prospective home buyers were solicited from a trailer located on the Laprairie site.  Co‑Hab's representative at this site entered into agreements for the purchase of the residences with a number of individuals, collecting deposits from them.  The contracts were made and the deposits taken on the basis of a representation by Co‑Hab that the deposits were insured by the Fédération de construction du Québec.  The representation was made orally.  It was backed up by a certificate of participation in the insurance program posted on the trailer wall, which had been furnished to Co‑Hab before it completed the application process.  In addition, a brochure describing the insurance program was distributed to most of the depositors.  In fact, the representations that the deposits were insured were false.  Co‑Hab never paid the premiums due on a first application for participation in the insurance program; a second application was never completed.  The trial judge found that Théroux, as the directing mind of Co‑Hab, was responsible for these misrepresentations.  The company which was to have built the residences became insolvent and could not complete the project.  Some of the depositors got their money back, but most lost the entire amount. ",

        "Facts": " The case began as a disagreement between two neighbours in the town of Milton, Nova Scotia.  The appellant, Donald Lohnes, lived across the street from a certain Mr. Porter.  Mr. Porter, it seems, was given to collecting equipment on his premises and running motors which made loud noises.  This disturbed Mr. Lohnes.  It disturbed him so much that on two occasions a year apart he went onto the veranda of his house and shouted obscenities at Mr. Porter.  The essence of Mr. Lohnes' remarks was that he did not want Mr. Porter \"to run that chain saw or that lawn mower or to leave that or have that God-damned junk heap\".  This was embellished by a string of epithets revealing an impressive command of the obscene vernacular.  On the second occasion Mr. Lohnes concluded his oration with the assertion that he would shoot Mr. Porter if he had a gun.  Mr. Porter filed a complaint.  He was the only Crown witness.  There was no evidence that anyone else heard Mr. Lohnes' statements or that Mr. Porter's conduct was affected by them.  Mr. Lohnes was convicted on the ground that his conduct in itself constituted a disturbance withins. 175(1)(a) of theCriminal Code; the trial judge found, as well, that Mr. Porter was \"disturbed\" by the impugned conduct.  The convictions were upheld by the summary conviction appeal court.  The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division refused leave from that decision: (1990), 100 N.S.R. (2d) 268, 272 A.P.R. 268.  He now appeals to this Court. ",

        "Facts": " The respondent was convicted of the murder of Aritha Monalisa King and was sentenced to imprisonment for life with no parole eligibility for thirteen years.  Both the respondent and Ms. King were American citizens, ordinarily resident in Detroit.  At the respondent's trial, the evidence showed that on August 6, 1986, the respondent picked up Ms. King at her mother's house in Detroit.  Together, they drove across the border to Canada.  The respondent spent the weekend of August 9 and 10 with Ms. King in a hotel in London, Ontario.  Ms. King's body was subsequently discovered at approximately 1:30 a.m. on August 11, near a service station at Beechville, Ontario.  The body was found lying on a sheet which may have come from the hotel where Ms. King and the respondent had spent the night.  Certain fibres found on the sheet matched fibres from the clothing of the respondent and Ms. King.  The body's arms had been cut off, and were never found.  The theory of the Crown was that the respondent was a drug smuggler who had travelled to Canada with Ms. King in order to obtain cocaine.  The Crown hypothesized that the respondent had asked Ms. King to take the cocaine back to the United States concealed in her body, but that she had refused.  According to the Crown, he then abandoned her at the hotel in London.  However, he later returned to pick her up, and drove her to a place where he strangled her, cut off her arms to impede identification, and dumped her body.  In support of this theory, the Crown relied upon evidence of four telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother in Detroit at 10:21 p.m., 11:21 p.m., 11:54 p.m. and 12:41 a.m. on the night between August 10 and August 11, 1986.  The first two telephone calls were traced to the telephone in Ms. King's room at the hotel in London.  Ms. King's mother testified that in the first telephone call, her daughter said that Larry (the respondent) had abandoned her at the hotel in London and that she wanted a ride home.  In the second call, Ms. King told her mother that Larry had still not returned.  Her mother testified that she then telephoned from Detroit to a taxi company in London to attempt to arrange a ride home for her daughter.  A taxi did arrive at the hotel, but refused to take Ms. King because the credit card that she had been using had been confiscated at the hotel.  The third call was traced to a pay telephone in the hotel lobby.  Ms. King's mother testified that in this call her daughter told her that Larry had come back for her, and that she would not need a ride home after all.  The fourth telephone call was traced to a pay telephone at the service station near which Ms. King's body was found.  Ms. King's mother testified that in this call her daughter told her that she was \"on her way\".  In addition to these calls, there was evidence that a further telephone call had been made shortly after 1:00 a.m. on August 11 from a pay telephone at the service station near which Ms. King's body was later found.  This call was traced to the respondent's residence in Detroit.  There was no direct evidence as to who made this telephone call, or what was said.  However, a witness at the service station testified that he had seen the respondent near the pay telephones at the service station around this time.  The Crown also led evidence from one Hope Denard, a woman who had travelled with the respondent from Detroit to Canada in the month prior to the murder.  Ms. Denard testified that the respondent had asked her to smuggle illegal drugs back to the United States for him, and that when she refused, he drove her to Windsor and abandoned her at a restaurant.  The respondent did not testify at his trial, but set up a defence of alibi supported by the evidence of various witnesses who placed him in Windsor or Detroit at or around the time of the murder.  Defence counsel did not object to the testimony by Ms. King's mother as to what her daughter told her in the first three telephone calls.  Indeed, it was apparently the theory of the defence that the respondent actually did abandon Ms. King at the hotel in London, a hypothesis supported by the evidence of what Ms. King said in the first two telephone calls to her mother.  However, the defence contended that after leaving Ms. King, the respondent returned to Detroit and did not return to the hotel, and therefore could not have been with her when she was murdered.  The respondent appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  The Court of Appeal found that evidence as to what was said in the telephone calls made by Ms. King to her mother on the night of the murder was hearsay, and therefore was inadmissible unless it fell within some recognized exception to the hearsay rule.  The Court of Appeal went on to decide that the evidence as to what was said by Ms. King in the first two telephone conversations was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, but only for the purpose of establishing her state of mind at the time when she made the calls, i.e., that she wanted to come home.  The evidence as to what was said in the third telephone conversation, however, fell within no exception to the hearsay rule, and was therefore not admissible for any purpose.  The Court of Appeal concluded that the inadmissible hearsay evidence had been so gravely prejudicial to the respondent that it could not say that, had it not been admitted, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.  Therefore, notwithstanding the failure of defence counsel to object to the evidence at trial, the Court of Appeal declined to apply the curative provision in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, quashed the respondent's conviction, and ordered a new trial:  (1990), 11 W.C.B. (2d) 497.  The Crown sought leave to appeal to this Court unders. 693(1)of theCriminal Code, and leave to appeal was granted (Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and McLachlin JJ.) on May 9, 1991:  [1991] 1 S.C.R. xiii. ",

Constable Smith proceeded to the hospital to obtain either a breath or blood sample from the respondent.  Smith arrived at the hospital at 5:26 a.m., only to discover that the respondent had wandered off.  He was found at 5:45 a.m. sitting in a hallway between two locked doors.  At 5:54 a.m., after consultation with a doctor, Constable Smith informed the respondent of his right to counsel and demanded a blood sample.  The respondent refused to comply with the demand, and was accordingly charged unders. 254(5)of theCriminal Code.  At trial in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia, the Crown called one witness, Constable Smith.  The respondent offered no evidence.  Campbell Prov. Ct. J. dismissed the charge because in his views. 254(3)of theCriminal Coderequires that a blood sample demand be made within two hours of the time when the impaired driving offence was committed.  An appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division was dismissed, Macdonald J.A. dissenting:  (1990), 100 N.S.R.

        "Facts": " The facts are basically quite simple.  On March 24, 1988, the appellant, Des Raj Sharma, was employed as a flower vendor in the city of Toronto, Ontario.  He was displaying his wares on Yonge Street near Dundas Street when he was approached by Constable Coulis of the Metropolitan Toronto Police.  Constable Coulis informed the appellant that exposing goods for sale on the street without a licence violated s. 11 of Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto By-law 211-74.  The appellant was issued a Provincial Offences ticket and instructed to pack up his display and move on.  Constable Coulis allowed the appellant a brief grace period to check with his employer or lawyer if he was uncertain about moving, but told him that if he was still there when the officer returned, he would face criminal charges of obstructing the police.  The appellant contacted his employer and was told that he was not to move.  The appellant was still operating on the street upon Constable Coulis's return. Accordingly, the appellant was charged with obstructing a peace officer contrary tos. 129of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly s. 118).  He was convicted of both offences under the by-law charge and the criminal charge in Provincial Court.  His appeals to District Court were dismissed.  A further appeal on both charges to the Ontario Court of Appeal, heard in conjunction with an appeal inR. v. Greenbaum(reasons in which are being released concurrently herewith), was also dismissed, Arbour J.A. dissenting: (1991), 44 O.A.C. 355, 77 D.L.R. (4th) 334, 62 C.C.C. (3d) 147, 3 C.R.

        "Facts": " This court has accordingly referred to the evidence taken at the preliminary inquiry.  After reviewing that evidence, the court concludes that the offences of indecent assault with which the accused is charged are disclosed by that evidence.  [Emphasis in original.]  The trial judge thus determined that the indictment did not have to be signed by the Attorney General and could be preferred by his prosecutor.  Quebec Court of Appeal,  [1991] R.J.Q. 741, 37 Q.A.C. 214  Malouf J.A. gave the reasons of the majority.  Monet J.A. filed separate reasons concurring in the result while Fish J.A. dissented.  Malouf J.A. observed that pursuant tos. 574of theCriminal Codean indictment can be preferred in respect of any charge founded on the facts disclosed in evidence at the preliminary hearing.  Section 574 provides:  574.(1) Subject to subsection (3) and section 577, the prosecutor may prefer an indictment against any person who has been ordered to stand trial in respect of  (a)               any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, or  (b)  any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial,  whether or not the charges were included in one information.  Malouf J.A. found that all the requirements of s. 574 were met in this case.  The preliminary hearing provided evidence which disclosed the offence of indecent assault.  As a result, the new indictment charging the accused with indecent assault did not require the Attorney General's signature.  When he read the reasons of his colleagues, Malouf J.A. added to his own reasons.  He observed that the appellant in this case had every opportunity to make full answer and defence.  At the time of the substituted indictment of indecent assault, the accused (appellant) had been completely informed as to the evidence pertaining to the offence with which he was charged and had received all the benefits that a preliminary inquiry can provide.  In his view, no prejudice had been occasioned by the substitution of the new indictment.  He noted as well that the procedural point upon which Fish J.A. based his dissent was not raised before the trial court or argued before the Court of Appeal.  The parties had not been given an  opportunity to review the issue and in his opinion the Court of Appeal should decline to decide that issue.  Monet J.A. in concurring reasons agreed that the original indictment was flawed.  Further he conceded thatR. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, established that the offences of indecent assault and sexual assault were not identical.  However, he went on to  observe that for the victim the terminology was unimportant.  For society, the reprobation was precisely the same.  For the accused in this case, the acts under investigation were identified and the circumstances surrounding those acts were fully investigated at the preliminary inquiry.  The accused had been committed for trial and this committal had not been attacked by the accused.  It followed that in his view the new indictment signed by the Attorney General's prosecutor was valid.  Fish J.A. found that the Crown was bound to prefer a direct indictment in the circumstances of this case.  Although the appellant's focus was on s. 577(b), which pertains to indictments preferred when a preliminary inquiry has been held, Fish J.A. based his reasons on s. 577(a).  He concluded the preliminary inquiry was a nullity and as a result it could not be said that there had been ade factopreliminary inquiry which led to a committal for trial.  In his view there could be no legal and valid trial on the first indictment because it disclosed no offence.  It followed that there could be no legal and valid inquiry on an information framed in such a way that it did not disclose an offence.  In his opinion there was no jurisdiction to hold the preliminary inquiry based on an information that was invalid.  In the result the preliminary inquiry and committal to trial were voidab initio.  Fish J.A. conceded that there were strong arguments in favour of the validity of the indictment.  He too observed that the essential elements of the charge which were investigated at the preliminary inquiry were, in fact, substantially if not legally identical to those for which the appellant was eventually tried.  Thus the appellant was fully apprised of the Crown's case against him.  Further, there was evidence adduced upon which the appellant could properly be committed to trial.  Thus all the policy requirements were satisfied, although the legal requirements were not.  In his view there had been no preliminary hearing and no committal to trial and as a result there could be no indictment preferred under s. 574(1)(b).",

        "Facts": " The appellant ran a business as a wholesaler of T‑shirts and sweatshirts.  Between November 1983 and January 1984, the appellant accepted goods with a value of more than $375,000 from his suppliers.  The goods were supplied by Château Lingerie Mfg. Co., Tricot Mondial Inc. and Elizabeth Lingerie Mfg. Ltd.  These suppliers delivered goods to the appellant in return for  post‑dated cheques or on credit.  Over a three-month period which began about mid‑November 1983, the appellant gambled away all of the assets of his business.  Among these assets were monies received from the sale of goods provided to the appellant by his suppliers.  On all of the occasions of gambling, the appellant lost money using a system which he believed would increase his odds of winning.  The appellant was declared bankrupt in February 1984.  He owed his suppliers for goods supplied: $238,311 to Château Lingerie, $94,213  to Tricot Mondial, and $45,294 to Elizabeth Lingerie.  He also owed $25,000 to a customer, Rose Dry Goods, for goods he had failed to supply.  At trial, Morier J.S.P. found the appellant guilty of fraud, on counts 1, 5, 8, and 11 of the indictment, and stayed the other counts on the basis of the principle articulated inKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  Counts 1, 5, 8, and 11 name the above mentioned suppliers and customer.  This finding was upheld on appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, with a dissent by Tyndale J.A.

        "Facts": " On April 24, 1988, Joseph Wright and his brother Steven got off a bus at an intersection in Scarborough, Ontario.  The brothers crossed the street and began walking home.  At about the same time, the respondent and three other young men were driving past the same intersection.  An argument started between the group in the car and the two men on the street and shortly thereafter a fight occurred.  The brothers were unarmed.  In the course of the fight one of the four persons from the vehicle pulled a knife, slashing twice at Joseph's face and then stabbing him in the chest.  The stab wound to the chest penetrated Joseph's heart and killed him.  The four young men then fled the scene.  About two weeks later, the three young men involved with the respondent in the incident were interviewed separately by the police.  While the appellant states that the three witnesses approached the police to make their statements, the respondent notes that two of the witnesses testified that they approached the police only after the police came to their homes in connection with the police investigation of the killing, and the third witness testified that it was his mother's idea that he give a statement to the police.  Each was accompanied by a parent and in one case by a lawyer and each was advised of his right to counsel.  It was also made clear that they were under no obligation to answer questions put to them by the police, and while the police told the witnesses that they were not charged with any offence, the interviewers also added the qualification \"at this time\" in two of the interviews.  With the youths' consent the interviews were videotaped.  In their statements, the three young men told the police that the respondent had made statements to them in which he acknowledged that he thought he had, or had, caused the death of the deceased by the use of a knife.  The respondent was charged with second degree murder and he entered a plea of not guilty.  Following an unsuccessful attempt by the Crown to have the case transferred to adult court, the respondent's trial commenced before Judge MacDonnell in Youth Court on November 14, 1989.  When called at trial by the Crown, the three young men refused to adopt their earlier statements respecting the admissions made by the respondent.  The trial judge allowed the Crown to cross-examine them on their prior statements pursuant tos. 9of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5.  They admitted they had made the statements to the police but said that they had lied to the police and that the respondent had not in fact made the incriminating statements that they had previously attributed to him.  Their explanation for having lied to the police was that they did so to exculpate themselves from possible involvement.  They claimed to have either forgotten what occurred when the respondent was alleged to have made his inculpatory statements, or to have not heard the respondent.  The trial judge held that the only use that could be made of the prior inconsistent statements of the three witnesses was with respect to their credibility, and that the prior inconsistent statements could not be used as evidence of the truth of the matters stated therein; that is, they could not be tendered as proof that the respondent actually made the admissions.  The only other evidence of the identity of the assailant was identification evidence provided by the victim's brother, who identified the accused at trial (in a \"dock\" identification with little evidential value) and testified as to the appearance of the deceased's assailant.  The trial judge found that the dock identification was \"naked opinion given 19 months after the event\", and that the brother had only a poor opportunity to observe his brother's attacker.  Doubts also existed in connection with his latter evidence because of several inconsistencies between elements of his description of the attacker shortly after the incident and elements of his description at trial, including:  the type of jacket and pants worn by the assailant, the clothing of the other youths, and the height and weight of the assailant relative to the other youths.  At trial, the respondent argues, several other elements of the brother's description did not match the respondent's characteristics, including:  the colour of the respondent's skin relative to the other youths, the fact that the assailant held the knife in his right hand while the respondent was described as left-handed by two of the recanting witnesses, whether the assailant wore jewellery, and the colour of the assailant's hair.  As a result of the doubt which existed with respect to the issue of identification, and in the absence of other admissible evidence, the trial judge acquitted the respondent.  The appellant appealed the acquittal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which stated that it was bound by the decisions of this Court, and accordingly dismissed the appeal.  Between the filing of the parties' facta and the hearing of this appeal, the three witnesses pleaded guilty to perjury.  The Crown brought a motion on the day of oral argument in this appeal to adduce this new evidence which it asserted was relevant to two issues:  (i) whether the operation of a revised rule would tend to enhance or detract from the public's perception of and respect for the administration of justice, and (ii) whether the application of the orthodox rule had caused a miscarriage of justice in this case.  Counsel for the respondent consented to the admission of this fresh evidence on this basis and for this purpose alone, and not as evidence of the respondent's innocence or guilt.  Counsel for the Crown agreed to this limitation.

        "Facts": " Hodgin's body was found on the morning of May 14, 1981, in a water-filled ditch near Stoney Creek, Ontario.  Medical evidence was that he died as a result of heavy blows to the head.  The time of death was estimated to be between 6:30 p.m. on May 13, 1981 and 6:30 a.m. on May 14, 1981.  Greater precision was not possible as the body had been almost completely submerged in water.  Hodgin had been seen leaving the Tap Room, a Hamilton bar, with the appellant Bevan at about 10:30 p.m. on May 13, 1981.  There was no evidence of the appellant Griffith's having been at that bar on that evening, or of his being seen that night with Hodgin.  The Crown's theory was that Griffith had been waiting in the area in a white car, and that after Bevan and Hodgin left the Tap Room the three drove to an unknown location, where the appellants beat Hodgin to death with tire irons.  On May 2, 1981, about 11 days prior to the murder, Emily Ribble, a friend of the appellants, was assaulted by Hodgin.  This was the alleged motive for the murder.  It was conceded by both appellants that they were upset about the beating of Ribble by Hodgin.  However, it was evident that a number of people had similar reasons to be upset with Hodgin.  The evidence was that he had a history of spontaneous violence towards women, including a previous conviction for manslaughter arising out of the stabbing death of a girlfriend.  In the weeks following the murder the police received information from several witnesses inculpating the appellants.  But they considered the evidence too weak to support a charge.  The investigation was suspended in early June 1981.  In late February 1982, Patrick Belmont, who had been arrested for property offences committed with the appellants, approached the police saying he had information about the murder.  He told the police about several incriminating conversations he had with Bevan.  He agreed to wear a bodypack and attempt to elicit further incriminating statements from the appellants.  The bodypack was suggested by the police because they viewed Belmont as unreliable.  According to Belmont, he had further conversations with Bevan, and with Griffith, in which each of the appellants implicated themselves in the murder.  However, due to malfunctions of the bodypack equipment, only about 20 percent of the conversations were audible to the police, none of which was incriminating.  In the spring of 1982, there was insufficient evidence to lay charges against the appellants, and the investigation was again discontinued.  In August 1986, Stefan Dietrich, who was serving a three-year sentence at Warkworth Penitentiary, wrote to Sgt. Ryan of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Force that he had information concerning Hodgin's murder.  The investigation was reactivated.  At the time of the murder, Dietrich was a 16-year-old chronic drug and alcohol abuser living with the appellant Griffith.  Dietrich testified that one evening in May 1981, the appellants left together in a car.  The next day, Dietrich was asked to help the appellants clean out the car, whose trunk contained two tire irons and a blood-soaked carpet.  Dietrich put all of the contents from the trunk into green garbage bags, and placed the bags at the front of Griffith's driveway for municipal garbage pickup.  Dietrich also testified to a number of incriminating statements made by the appellants, particularly Griffith.  The appellants were arrested in September 1986.  At their trial they testified in their own defence, denying or explaining the inculpatory statements allegedly made in the presence of Dietrich, Belmont, and/or other witnesses.  As well each of them offered alibi defences.  The appellants admitted in their testimony at trial that each had lied in statements to the police.  After his September 1986 arrest, the appellant Griffith gave a statement exculpating himself but inculpating Bevan.  At his trial, Griffith denied the truth of the parts of his statement inculpating Bevan, stating that he was confused when he gave the statement and told the police what he thought they wanted to hear because he was scared.  The appellant Bevan did not give the police a statement in 1986, but in a statement made to them shortly after the murder, he falsely stated he and Ribble had gone to Ribble's mother's on May 13, 1981.  Bevan admitted that he lied to the police about how he had injured his hand about the time of the murder.  There was evidence, some admitted and some denied by Bevan, that he had asked other witnesses to lie to the police about various matters related to his conduct around the date of the murder.  Crucial evidence against the appellants was the testimony of Dietrich, and, to a lesser extent, Belmont.  In her charge to the jury, the trial judge noted credibility was important in this case, discussed generally how credibility should be assessed, and made some references to factors affecting the credibility of Belmont and Dietrich.  She did not, however, in the language ofVetrovecgive a clear sharp warning to the jury as to its being dangerous to convict the appellants on the basis of the evidence of Belmont and Dietrich unless their evidence was supported by other evidence.  Nor did she instruct the jury on the use that could be made of prior inconsistent statements.  Dietrich's letter of August 1986 was read aloud by him during his direct examination.  It contained a number of statements prejudicial to the appellants.  Defence counsel then used the letter in cross-examination to attack Dietrich's testimony and credibility, on the basis of Dietrich's apparent animosity towards the appellants and his motivations for lying to the police and at trial.  It was subsequently marked as an exhibit and without objection was given to the jury.

        "Facts": " In the circumstances of this case, however, the trial judge was not in error in inviting the jury to \"reject\" the factual proposition in one of the two statements, depending on which they believed, because both statements emanated from the accused, and, as La Forest J. states, could not logically co-exist.  There was only a single determination of credibility to be made.  If they believed the accused's exculpatory evidence at trial, they must of necessity have disbelieved his inculpatory statements to the police.  It must be remembered, though, that the accused need never establish his or her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt; that standard only and always applies to the Crown.  The accused must only raise a reasonable doubt with his or her evidence, even where he or she bears an evidentiary burden; seeR. v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525.  With these observations, I would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by La Forest J.  //Le juge La Forest//  The judgment of La Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by  La Forest J.-- The appellant, John Alexander MacKenzie, was accused of murdering three of his neighbours in the early hours of June 24, 1989.  At trial, a jury found him not guilty.  The acquittal was overturned on appeal, and a new trial was ordered.  The appellant appealed to this Court as of right, seeking the restoration of his acquittal.  At the time of his trial, the appellant was 47 years old.  He was an alcoholic.  In 1985, after living for 25 years in Toronto, he moved back to his home community in rural Antigonish County, Nova Scotia.  He purchased a plot of land in Beech Hill, and in 1988 moved a mobile home onto the lot and made it his home.  The three victims of the shooting, John Boucher, Joseph Deon and Edmund Deon, were neighbours of the appellant.  Each owned a home on the Beech Hill Road within a kilometre of the appellant's property.  The Deons were brothers, and were good friends of Boucher.  For some reason, the Deons and Boucher apparently engaged in a concerted campaign of harassment against the appellant that lasted from the time he moved to Beech Hill until their deaths.  This harassment verged on terrorism, consisting of repeated property damage, the killing of the appellant's pets, shooting bullet holes through his mailbox, and a series of threats to shoot him or dynamite his trailer.  In the early morning of Saturday, June 24, 1989 the Deons and Boucher were shot to death.  Boucher was shot three times in his yard, Edmund Deon was shot seven times in his bedroom, and Joseph Deon was shot twice while sitting at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was parked in his driveway.  All the shots came from the appellant's .22 calibre revolver.  The revolver was retrieved by police the next day from the appellant's well, along with a pair of his shoes.  During the six weeks before the shootings the appellant was drinking heavily.  On June 12, two weeks before the shootings, he discovered that a calf of his was missing.  Suspecting his neighbours, he took his revolver and confronted Boucher and his wife Lorraine at their home.  They were able to calm the appellant down, and she drove him home.  At trial, the appellant testified that Lorraine Boucher took his revolver from him at that time, and that this was the last he saw it.  Mrs. Boucher did not testify on this point.  Later that evening, the appellant decided to confront Edmund Deon about the calf.  He could not find his revolver, so he took a .303 rifle with him.  During the confrontation that ensued the appellant discharged the rifle into the floor of Deon's house.  The next day the RCMP arrested the appellant, detained him overnight, and confiscated his rifle.  On June 23 the appellant spent most of the day drinking at his mobile home with his brother-in-law, William Cogger.  The appellant consumed about 21 beers during the day.  Boucher visited them for about an hour in the evening, drank at least one beer, and left without any dispute or incident.  At around 11:00 p.m. the appellant and Cogger went to sleep.  Sometime during the night, they were awakened by a knock at the door.  Cogger testified that he heard the appellant say \"who's there?\", that a voice responded, and that the appellant said \"I'm sleeping. Go home. I'm going back to sleep\".  Cogger heard nothing more, and fell back asleep.  The appellant testified that the visitor was Joseph Deon.  At 4:17 a.m. Daniel Girrior, another neighbour on the Beech Hill Road, was awakened by three gunshots.  It was not unusual to hear gunshots at night in that area, so Girrior went back to sleep.  William Cogger awoke at 4:45 a.m. to find the appellant sitting fully dressed at a table.  Cogger testified that the appellant said he got the \"three sons-of-whores last night.\"  Cogger said \"tell me this is not the truth\", to which the appellant replied \"no brother it's not true.\"  The appellant then said he was going to put his gun down the well, and left the house.  On returning, he spoke about getting rid of his shoes.  At 4:58 a.m. Daniel Girrior heard three shots.  Two minutes later he heard three more shots.  At trial, the appellant testified that he fell back to sleep after Boucher's early morning visit.  The next thing he remembered was waking up on the floor, with the idea that he had seen the bodies of the Deons and Boucher on the Beech Hill Road.  He felt he must have been dreaming, and told Cogger about the dream.  He was surprised to see his revolver on the table, as he had not seen the gun since Lorraine Boucher took it from him two weeks earlier.  The appellant had no recollection of shooting the Deons and Boucher, or of throwing the revolver and the shoes down the well.  The appellant and Cogger spent the rest of June 24 drinking.  At about 9:00 p.m. the appellant was arrested by the RCMP.  Realizing that he was drunk, the police did not attempt to question him.  He was given food and at 11:30 p.m. was put in jail for the night.  The next morning the appellant was given breakfast, and then brought before two officers for questioning.  He was advised of his right to silence and to counsel, and the officers then told him they had reason to believe he had put his gun and shoes down his well, and that he had previously been seen at the Boucher house.  They asked the appellant for his side of the story, and he volunteered an incriminating statement about the shootings.  One of the officers took notes for about ten minutes, and then suggested that the statement should be in a formal written form.  At this point the appellant requested legal counsel, and the officers told the appellant that there would be no more questions.  The officers left the appellant alone to call his sister so she could retain a lawyer.  When they returned a pause of several minutes ensued when nothing was said.  The accused then started in on a more detailed and explicit statement.  This second statement was excluded by the trial judge because it was made after the appellant had exercised his right to counsel.  At trial, the appellant said his \"confession\" to the police was in fact a recounting of his second-hand knowledge of the shootings gained from other neighbours during the day of drinking following the shootings.  He remembers little of his statements to the police, other than that he was suffering at the time from \"the worst hangover of my life\".  During a four-hour jury charge, MacIntosh J. instructed the jury on the law regarding the defences of provocation and drunkenness, and that there were four possible verdicts on each murder count: not guilty, guilty of first degree murder, second degree murder, or manslaughter.  He also instructed the jury on how to evaluate the contradiction between the appellant's statements to the police and his testimony at trial.  Part of this instruction was as follows: ",

C-46 , requires that the Crown prove two essentials of the mental element of the offence before being able to secure a conviction.  The first concerns the knowledge or belief of the accused as to the purpose of the transaction.  When an agent is charged, it must be established that he or she demanded, accepted or offered or agreed to accept the benefit as a quid pro quo to influence him or her.  A benefit cannot be demanded or received in consideration for doing an act if the taker did not believe that it was being demanded, offered or given for that purpose.  Thus the Crown must prove that the benefit was so demanded, offered or accepted with the agent's knowledge or belief that it was given for that purpose.  This requirement looks to the state of mind of the agent at the time of the transaction.  The corruption in this action is the belief that the valuable consideration is intended to influence the agent to show favour to some person in relation to the affairs of his or her principal.  The taker is thus caught even if he or she was mistaken as to the true intention of the giver.",
            "McLachlin J. -- I have read the reasons of Sopinka J. and Cory J. and agree with Cory J. that the appeal must be dismissed. As I have outlined in my reasons in R. v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 000, which are being released concurrently, I agree with Cory J. that lack of disclosure is an element of the actus reus of the offence under s. 426(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and that an awareness of that lack of disclosure is an element of its mens rea. I depart from Cory J. on two points, however. First, with respect to the timing of disclosure, certainty requires that where the gravamen of the offence is the taking of a secret commission disclosure to the principal must be made by the time the commission is accepted. Second, with respect to the degree of disclosure required, the requirements of s. 426(1)(a)(ii) will, in my view, be satisfied if the agent discloses to the principal that he will receive a commission with respect to the transaction in question. Thus, an agent who advises his principal in advance that he will be receiving a commission with respect to a particular transaction will be innocent of any offence under s. 426(1)(a)(ii)."
        ],
        "Facts": " There is no doubt that the facts in this case arouse more sympathy for the appellants than did those inKelly.  Nevertheless, the question as to whether the disclosure was adequate in all the circumstances must still be determined.  I cannot accept the contention that the findings made at the trial are adequate to resolve the issue.  The Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that the trial judge's finding that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite intent was based on a misapprehension as to the intent required. For the reasons set out inKelly, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that there was a corrupt bargain.  Nor was the trial judge correct as to the standard of disclosure that was required.  The argument that there was a finding made at trial that there was no secrecy on the part of the appellants cannot be accepted.  That finding was made only in relation to the appellants' books which disclosed all the transactions.  The testimony given by clients of the appellants was overwhelmingly to the effect that no disclosure was made to them that commissions would be received by the appellants from the promoters of the developments for the sale of the units.  It will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, the disclosure made by the appellants to their clients was adequate and timely.  The Court of Appeal correctly determined that there must be a new trial with regard to that issue.

        "Facts": " In 1987, Christine Naglik (to whom I shall refer as \"Naglik\", as she is both appellant and respondent before this Court) and her common law husband, Peter Geoffrey Pople, were charged with the aggravated assault of, and failure to provide necessaries of life to, their infant son Peter Naglik.  The Crown proceeded by indictment.  The evidence established that Peter Naglik, then aged 11 weeks, was brought to hospital where he was found to have sustained a number of serious injuries (including a broken collarbone, fractured ribs in at least 15 places, a fractured vertebra, two separate skull fractures, and haemorrhaging of the brain and the retina) which had caused permanent damage.  The injuries had been sustained over a period of time, estimated by physicians to be four weeks.  Naglik gave exculpatory statements concerning her child's condition to police and other authorities which were inconsistent with the medical evidence at trial.  At trial before a judge and jury, Naglik did not testify.  Pople did testify, denying any involvement in causing the injuries to the child, and claiming that Naglik was the child's primary caregiver.  Pople's counsel sought, and obtained, permission to comment on the failure of Naglik to testify.  The trial judge allowed the comment, warning counsel that it had \"better be within the bounds of propriety\".  In his address, Pople's counsel stated, in part:  The evidence shows that it must have been at least one of them.  Now, he has sworn before you that it wasn't him.  Your eyes turn to the other and she does not get up and deny it.  Her counsel makes an effort to put it on Peter Pople, to accuse him conjecturally, but she doesn't get up or explain anything or accuse anyone.  In response, Naglik's counsel explaineds. 11(c)of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and pointed out that she had made exculpatory statements to various persons in authority at the first opportunity, unlike Pople.  Naglik's counsel also moved for a mistrial because of the comment, but the motion was denied.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge remarked that, unders. 215of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly s. 197), the appropri­ate test to be applied was an objective one, and that the jury should convict if they were of the view that the parent \"knew, or ought to have known, the seriousness of the child's con­dition and that it required medical attention\".  With respect to the need for a unanimous verdict, the trial judge initially charged the jury as follows:  In other words, each and all of you must agree on each verdict that you see fit to return with respect to each accused.  It is your right to disagree but I know you will do your best to come to an agreement.  This trial has involved considerable time and expense and there have been the lives of people, your lives, the lives of witnesses, have been disrupted and I am certain that no other jury can deal with this matter better than you.  The jury retired at 3:08 p.m.  They returned to ask a question at 3:35 p.m., which the trial judge answered, and then again at 4:35 p.m., when they asked \"Do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty?\"  The trial judge answered this question as follows:  Your question is \"do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty\".  Well, the 12 of you have to agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty with respect to count one and with respect to each accused.  In other words, you must be unanimous one way or the other with respect to each accused and with respect to each count.  Is that confusing?  In other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the other.  The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts for both Naglik and Pople at 8:08 p.m., and was polled at the request of defence counsel.  Both were sentenced to four and one-half years on the first count (aggravated assault) and two years on the second count (failure to provide necessaries), to be served concurrently.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed Naglik's appeal from her conviction on the second count (failure to provide necessaries), set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial on that count:  (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 385, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272, 46 O.A.C. 81.  Naglik has appealed the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to comment by counsel for a co-accused by leave, and with respect to the charge to the jury as of right (based on a dissent by Morden A.C.J.O.).  The Attorney General for Ontario has cross-appealed the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to themens reafor s. 215 by leave.

        "Facts": " On the morning of November 11, 1987, the appellant, a 16-year veteran of the Montreal police force, and his partner, Kimberley Campbell, responded to a call from a taxi driver complaining of a customer who refused to pay his fare.  The customer identified himself as Tony Bowers.  The appellant learned over the police radio that this information was false.  Based on papers that he was carrying, the individual was identified as Tony Griffin, for whom there was an arrest warrant outstanding.  The appellant then arrested Mr. Griffin and brought him to the police station.  The officers also received from the cab driver a bag belonging to Mr. Griffin which contained approximately 150 packs of cigarettes.  The officers suspected that these cigarettes had come into the possession of Mr. Griffin illegally.  Upon arriving at the station, Ms. Campbell went to retrieve the cigarettes from the trunk of the car, the appellant opened the rear door to let Mr. Griffin out, and at that moment, Mr. Griffin attempted to flee.  The appellant chased after him, taking his gun out of its holster as he ran.  The gun was held at the side of his right leg, pointing at the ground.  The appellant yelled in the direction of Mr. Griffin, \"Stop or I'll shoot.\"  The appellant then pointed his gun at Mr. Griffin with his index finger on the trigger.  He claimed that he did this in order to intimidate Mr. Griffin because he was not responding to the order to stop.  The Crown's position, however, is that Mr. Griffin had already stopped running forward and had begun running on the spot \"dodging like a boxer\", when he turned to face the appellant.  At that moment, a shot went off, fatally striking Mr. Griffin in the head.  These events all took place in the police station parking lot.  The gun used by the appellant can be fired either by \"single action\", where the gun is already cocked and only slight pressure on the trigger is required, or by \"double action\", requiring very strong pressure on the trigger so as to raise the hammer and then fire a shot.  The appellant was charged with manslaughter underss. 234and236of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly ss. 217 and 219).  At trial, he testified that he was not aware of cocking the gun and never made a decision to do so; however, the appellant acknowledged that the gun must have been cocked at the time he pointed it at Mr. Griffin.  He further indicated that he never intended to shoot and that the gun went off accidentally.  The appellant was acquitted by a jury.  On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, the acquittal was set aside and a new trial was ordered: [1991] R.J.Q. 1567, 67 C.C.C. (3d) 156, 6 C.R. (4th) 239, 37 Q.A.C. 161.  The appellant appeals to this Court as of right under s. 691(2)(a) of theCode.  ",

            "Sopinka J. -- The appellant, Kevin Martie Morin, was charged with two counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, under ss. 249(4)  and 249(3)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46  respectively.  The charges arose out of an accident which occurred at approximately 7:30 a.m. on February 28, 1990, near Spruce Grove, Alberta, at the intersection of Campsite Road, a secondary highway, and Highway 16X, a four lane divided highway.",
            "The trial judge found the appellant to be negligent, but not guilty of the offences charged on the basis that the \"necessary criminal element\" required for a conviction for dangerous driving under the Criminal Code  was not present in his conduct.  The majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and directed a new trial on all three charges:  (1991), 117 A.R. 36, 2 W.A.C. 36, 30 M.V.R.

        "Facts": " Fraser J.A. thus concluded that by failing to consider all relevant evidence and by failing to ask herself whether the manner of the appellant's driving considered in its totality amounted to dangerous driving, the trial judge had erred in law.  She stated in part:  (1)\"... it was open to the trial Judge to have inferred that the sun would not have presented a visibility problem had Morin stopped and looked to the east along the highway before leaving the stop sign.  This issue was not addressed by the trial Judge\" (p. 96).  (2)The trial judge failed to consider the evidence in its totality.  Accordingly, the trial judge failed to appreciate or disregarded material evidence.  Under these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant's driving was such as to constitute dangerous driving.  In support of this conclusion, Her Ladyship relied on the following passages fromR. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at pp. 71, 72 and 77:  An acquittal based on an erroneous conclusion of reasonable doubt constitutes a question of law where the trial judge has erred as to the legal effect of undisputed or found facts rather than the inferences to be drawn from such facts.  ...  A question of law may also arise, it seems to me, when the trial judge misdirects himself or herself with respect to the relevant evidence.  ...  A review of the trial judge's decision in this case makes it clear that he failed to consider the evidence in its totality.  This was the result of misdirection and brought the matter within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

        "Facts": "The events giving rise to this appeal took place over an 18-hour period beginning on the evening of October 26, 1989.  A group including the appellant, Marc Creighton, and the deceased, Ms. Martin, consumed a large quantity of alcohol and cocaine that night.  In the afternoon of the following day, the appellant, a companion (Frank Caddedu) and the deceased planned to share a quantity of cocaine at the deceased's apartment.  The evidence indicates that all of the parties involved were experienced cocaine users.  The appellant obtained an \"eight-ball\" (3.5 gr.) of cocaine.  He did not seek to determine the quality or potency of the cocaine before injecting the drug intravenously into himself and Frank Caddedu.  With the consent of the deceased, the appellant then injected a quantity of cocaine into the deceased's right forearm.  She immediately began to convulse violently and appeared to cease breathing.  Subsequent expert testimony confirmed that, as a result of the injection, she had experienced a cardiac arrest, and later asphyxiated on the contents of her stomach.  Both the appellant and Mr. Caddedu attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ms. Martin.  Mr. Caddedu indicated he wanted to call for emergency assistance but the appellant, by verbal intimidation, convinced Mr. Caddedu not to call 911.  The appellant placed the deceased, who was still convulsing, on her bed.  The appellant then proceeded to clean the apartment of any possible fingerprints.  The two men then left the apartment.  Mr. Caddedu returned unaccompanied to the deceased's apartment six or seven hours later and called for emergency assistance.  Ms. Martin was thereupon pronounced dead.  The appellant related a substantially different version of the events in question, but this testimony was disbelieved by the trial judge. The appellant was charged with manslaughter.  Defence counsel conceded at trial that the injection into the deceased's body constituted \"trafficking\" within the meaning of s. 4(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1.  The Crown argued that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter as Ms. Martin's death was the direct consequence of an unlawful act, contrary tos. 222(5)(a) of theCriminal Code.  The appellant was convicted of manslaughter on May 18, 1990, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  The appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which affirmed the conviction. ",

Avoir direwas held regarding the admissibility of the inculpatory statement.  Landerkin Prov. Ct.

The complainant, R.S., was born on March 12, 1979, and disclosed the sexual occurrences in March of 1988.  In May 1988, following a medical examination of the complainant, the police began an investigation of the allegations.  In August 1988, a videotape interview of the complainant took place.  The complainant, a female child who was nine years old at the time of the videotaping, indicated that the respondent, her grandfather, had put his hand inside her \"privates\" and had touched her \"chest\".  She further indicated that this had happened \"lots of times\".  R.S. also mentioned that the respondent had warned her not to tell anybody or else he would hurt her.  The respondent was charged in October 1988.  At the preliminary inquiry, held in May and June 1989, the complainant testified before the court.  At the trial, held in November and December 1989, the Crown sought to introduce the videotaped interview of the complainant, pursuant to the dispositions of 715.1 of theCriminal Code.  The respondent moved for a declaration that s. 715.1 was unconstitutional as it contravened ss. 7 and 11(d) of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.  The trial judge dismissed the motion, upholding the constitutionality of s. 715.1.  Following avoir dire, at which the complainant, her mother and the sergeant involved in making the videotape testified, the videotaped interview was admitted into evidence.  The trial judge convicted the respondent on one count of sexual assault.  No verdict was entered with respect to the count of sexual interference by application of theKienappleprinciple.  The other counts of sexual assault related to two other complainants.  On June 18, 1991, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowed the respondent D.O.L.'s appeal against conviction and declareds. 715.1of theCriminal Codeunconstitutional: (1991), 73 Man. R. (2d) 238, 3 W.A.C. 238, 6 C.R. (4th) 277, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 465.  A new trial was ordered. ",

        "Facts": " On February 23, 1990, before a judge and jury, the respondent was found guilty of engaging in anal intercourse with his step-son and sentenced to four years imprisonment.  J.E., the complainant, was 13 years of age at the time of the trial and kindergarten-aged at the time of the alleged incidents.  If his story is true, he lived for a period of some months in a household marked by brutal physical and sexual abuse.  The trial judge conducted an inquiry into J.E.'s understanding of the oath and was satisfied that he could be sworn to testify.  J.E. was the only Crown witness on the material points.  His sworn testimony was that, from the age of five, he was subjected to repeated and violent sexual acts by his step-father, the respondent.  The respondent testified on his own behalf and denied the allegations.  Additionally, J.E. testified that his mother forced him to perform oral sex with her, that his step-brother forced him to perform oral and anal sex with him and that his step-sister coerced him to participate in sexual acts with her.  All of these individuals denied such incidents took place.  The defence's theory of the case was that J.E. was actually the victim of abuse over this period at the hands of his natural father.  J.E. testified that he was not abused by his natural father, whom he saw periodically during this time; his mother, however, testified that he looked nervous and shaken after these visits.  The case boiled down to a question of credibility and the jury believed J.E. over the accused.  The respondent's appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal was argued on February 28, 1991.  On June 21, 16 months after the trial, and while the judgment of the Court of Appeal was still reserved, the trial judge wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal containing the following comments:  This accused's appeal from conviction, as I understand it, has been argued and is now reserved.  I recall this trial very clearly.  Were I sitting alone, I would not have found the accused guilty on the evidence at trial. I was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be an unsafe one and I would have said as much to the jury if I thought it were proper for me to do so -- bearing in mind the jury's function.  There were some improbabilities in the young complainant's testimony which concerned me and this, together with the evidence of the accused and the other defence witnesses, created a reasonable doubt in my mind.  I have been concerned about this case since the verdict, particularly when I sentenced [A.W.E.] for this serious crime.  I remain concerned today.  Copies of this letter were forwarded to the Crown prosecutor and to defence counsel.  The Court of Appeal asked for further submissions in light of this letter.  Further written submissions were received and judgment rendered on November 21, 1991.  The Court of Appeal found the verdict of the jury unsafe, quashed the conviction, and gave the Crown leave to proceed with a new trial if it so desired.  On April 9, 1992, the Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court, [1992] 1 S.C.R. x.

        "Facts": " F.F.B., the appellant, is the uncle of P.A.L., the complainant.  The appellant lived with his sister E.L.'s family during the fifties and sixties in Nova Scotia.  Mr. and Mrs. L. were rarely at home and F.F.B. was responsible for the care of the L.'s twelve children.  P.A.L. testified that the appellant began abusing her physically and sexually when she was six to eight years old and continued to do so until she was sixteen, at which time the appellant left the L. household.  P.A.L. testified that the sexual abuse began with kissing, escalated to sexual touching and culminated in sexual intercourse when she was ten years old.  The first incident of sexual intercourse allegedly resulted in P.A.L.'s hospitalization for twelve days with serious internal bleeding; she and the appellant both related at the time that she had injured herself while playing on the bannister of the front veranda.  P.A.L. testified that a month after her return from the hospital, the appellant commenced to have sexual intercourse with her daily.  P.A.L. gave birth to two sons at ages fifteen and sixteen, allegedly as a result of the sexual abuse by the appellant.  Stories were apparently fabricated as to how these pregnancies occurred.  P.A.L. was a shy person who had little contact outside the home; she testified that the appellant used constant threats and fear to enforce his will on her.  P.A.L. testified that during this period she was also subject to repeated physical assaults.  She testified to several specific incidents:  that the appellant once pushed her to the ground and stepped on her face; that the appellant seriously cut her leg with a broken milk bottle; that the appellant burned her with a cigarette butt; and that the appellant forced her to consume a bottle of castor oil which resulted in her miscarrying a child.  She stated that she bears numerous scars which resulted from this abuse.  She also testified that the other children in the household were physically abused and terrorized by the appellant.  In 1964, T.B., an older brother of P.A.L., caught the appellant having sexual intercourse with P.A.L.  As a result, the appellant was forced to leave the L.'s household.  In 1990, P.A.L. saw the appellant in a store.  She testified that she decided then to report the alleged assaults to the police.  As a result of this report, the appellant was charged with two counts of rape, three counts of assault, and one count of procuring a miscarriage.  The appellant denied that any of the incidents described by P.A.L. occurred.  During the course of the trial, the judge decided on avoir direnot to admit the evidence of D.M.L. (the complainant's sister) that she too had been sexually assaulted by the appellant, on the ground that it fell within the similar fact evidence rule and its prejudicial effect was not outweighed by its probative value.  However, testimony of the complainant's brothers and sisters was admitted with respect to the violent control that the appellant exerted within the household.  The appellant was convicted by a jury on five of the six counts (he was found not guilty of the charge of procuring miscarriage).  He was sentenced to a total period of incarceration of 13 years.  The appellant appealed his conviction to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on two grounds which were both dismissed.  At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court of Appeal requested counsel to make further written submissions on two issues that had been raised in oral argument.  One of these related to the admissibility of evidence given by P.A.L.'s brother, L.L., and her step-brother, T.B.  The appellant sought to have declared inadmissible those parts of L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony which related to assaults by the appellant on P.A.L.'s siblings.  The appellant was not seeking to exclude the evidence of T.B. that he finally discovered the appellant sexually assaulting P.A.L. and drove F.F.B. out of the house.  The appellant's appeal on this ground was dismissed, Chipman and Hallett JJ.A. concurring in separate reasons that the testimony of L.L. and T.B. was admissible.  Jones J.A. dissented, holding that L.L.'s and T.B.'s evidence was inadmissible since it was too prejudicial in relation to its probative value, and because it did not come within the parameters of the similar fact exception to the rule which excludes evidence of the accused's bad character.  The appellant has appealed the judgment of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on this point to this Court as of right, unders. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. ",

        "Facts": " On March 24, 1990, the car the appellant was driving was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  At the scene of the accident, the police formed the opinion that the appellant was impaired, and demanded samples of his blood for analysis.  They did not demand a breath sample because the appellant had some lacerations on his face and they thought that the presence of blood in the appellant's mouth might affect the accuracy of a breath sample analysis.  The appellant agreed to the blood sample demand and was taken to a hospital where a nurse took the blood samples.  At the hospital the appellant asked why blood samples were being taken; the investigating constable told him that two blood samples would be taken and that one was for police use while the other was kept for him in case he wanted to analyze it later on.  The appellant was not charged with any offence at this time, although the investigating officer told the appellant that he would be charged with impaired driving in due course.  The trial judge found, however, that in the circumstances the appellant did not have notice of the retention of the second blood sample, a point to which I shall return later.  On May 22, 1990, some two months after the accident, the appellant was charged with two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm (Criminal Code, s. 255(2)) and one \"over 80\" count (driving with a blood-alcohol content of more than 80 mg per 100 ml of blood --Criminal Code, s. 253(b)).  At the same time he was served with a Certificate of Analyst (CA) which revealed that he had had four times the statutory limit of concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time the samples were taken.  The Certificate of Analyst did not mention the existence of a second blood sample.  He was tried on September 21, 1990.  In the six months between the time he gave blood samples and his trial, he neither requested the extra sample of his blood nor applied to any court for its release.  The appellant was served with a Certificate of Qualified Technician (CQT) the day before his trial.  The CQT stated, among other things, that the taking of the two samples complied with theCriminal Code, and that a second sample was taken to permit an analysis to be made by or on behalf of the accused.  The delay in serving the CQT was apparently because of inadvertence, and the Crown called the technician (the nurse who had taken the samples) as a witness at trial.  The appellant was acquitted of all counts when the trial judge refused to admit the CQT and the CA into evidence.  With that the \"over 80\" charge fell.  The trial judge also dismissed the other two charges for other reasons.  The respondent's appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal which ordered a new trial on all counts.

        "Facts": " Before leaving this question, I should comment on two points.  The first is the argument that the divergent stories of the complainant and the accused on consent, as a matter of law, necessarily preclude a third alternative, the defence of honest but mistaken belief.  I am not so convinced as my colleagues that where the evidence consists of two diametrically opposed stories, one alleging lack of consent and the other consent, it is logically impossible to conceive of the defence of honest but mistaken belief arising.  While it may rarely occur, it seems to me possible for a jury to accept parts of the testimonies of both the complainant and the accused, concluding that notwithstanding lack of actual consent, the accused honestly believed in consent.  As A. W. Bryant states:  ...the removal of this alternative plea on the basis that the testimony of the complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed, and that there is a lack of common ground for the defence is based, in part, on the premise that the complainant's version is complete -- a questionable assumption in some cases.  Moreover, a requirement for corroboration may wrongly encourage an accused to dovetail partially his testimony with that of the complainant in order to supply the necessary common ground for the defence.

        "Facts": " The appellant E.T. was convicted in Youth Court of the second degree murder of a cab driver on October 12, 1988.  E.T. was at the time a 16-year-old drop-out who lived with his great-aunt, C.T., a 62-year-old Elder of the Tsawout Band with two years of schooling.  Three other persons, two young offenders, A. and L.I.R., and an adult of approximately 23 years, were also implicated in this murder.  The adult, Michael Allen, was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of manslaughter.  His trial and the appeals therefrom took place prior to commencement of the trial of the young offenders and Allen gave evidence for the Crown at the latter trial.  The three young offenders were charged with first degree murder.  The Crown's theory was that the death of the cab driver was the intended culmination of a plan to rob a taxi cab driver.  The trial judge concluded on a no-evidence motion that with respect to all three accused there was no evidence of first degree murder.  The Youth Court judge convicted the appellant and A. of murder in the second degree and L.I.R. of manslaughter.  During the course of the trial, the Crown sought to have admitted as evidence two statements made by E.T. to the police after the killing.   The trial judge excluded a first statement made the day of E.T.'s arrest, but admitted a second statement made the next day.  The circumstances surrounding the making of the two statements were as follows.  On the morning of October 12 (the murder of the cab driver having taken place in the very early hours of that morning), the appellant was arrested at his home, warned, and his clothes were seized.  He asked that his great-aunt, C.T., whom he regarded as his mother, be allowed to come with him and the two were taken to the RCMP station.  While en route to the station in the police car, C.T. began searching in her purse for her lawyer's card, and was advised by the police officers that \"all of that\" would be taken care of at the police station.  When they arrived at the station, however, E.T. and his aunt were taken directly to an interview room, and Constable Logan commenced taking a statement from E.T. which lasted some four and a half hours.  The statement was preceded by the following exchange which involved the filling out of the Statement to Person in Authority form required bys. 56of theYoung Offenders Act:  [Logan]. . . Now um, [E.], I'm gonna do, give you the ah, give you your choices of, of giving a statement to a person in authority, you understand that I'm a person in authority.  I've identified myself as Constable Matt LOGAN and um, given you the, the same ah, type of thing at your home, but I'd like to give it to you again and in front of both of you so you understand. . . . First of all um, I'm explaining to you that you, that you're under no obligation to give a statement.  ET                      Yeah.  [Logan]That any statements that I may give may be used as evidence in proceedings against me.  I've been given an opportunity to speak to a lawyer or a parent or in the absence of a parent, the adult relative or in the presence or the absence of a parent or an adult relative, an adult of my own choosing.  And you're choice that you gave me at the home would still stay the same that you wish to speak to ah, to me in front of your, in front of your ah, grand-aunt, in front of [C.T.], aye.  Ah, do you refer to [C.T.] as mom?  ET   Yeah.  . . .  [Logan]. . . Okay now ah, out of those choices I wish to speak with one of my parents, I wish to speak with an adult relative or an adult of my own choosing ah, you would circle which one and I'll let you go ahead and do it.  ET               Well (undecipherable).  [Logan]Your mom um, [C.T.] would be a, an adult of your ah, your choosing, yeah.  ET (undecipherable).  [Logan]. . . Relative now, now here it says I have the right to give my statement in the presence ah, of and you circle your choice.  You have the right to give in the presence of a lawyer, of a parent or of an adult relative or an adult of your own choosing.  And you just circle the person that you would like in the room when you ah, when you give a statement.  ET I guess one of my parents?  [Logan]Um . . . probably the presence of an adult relative would be the choice there.  Um, [C.T] is like a parent but she um, we'd have to go with an adult relative.  Okay.  Um ...  ET               Sign right here?  [Logan]Okay, right, I need your signature right there, yeah.  And I'll get [C.T.] to sign it too.  Just figure out where she should sign it first.  . . .  [C.T. signs and Constable Logan signs.]  [Logan]. . . I think before we start off ah, you know I understand you're sixteen years of age, you're ah, you know you're just starting out in life.  ET               Yeah.  [Logan] And um, you know, you've got a long way, long life ahead of you, long ways to go and ah, you'll make a lot of decisions in your life and today is one, is a decision that you have to make on whether to ah, whether to tell us the truth about what happened and ah . . . your truthfulness will make a lot of ah, make a lot of things come clear and ah, it'll be a major, major thing in your, in your life to, to do that.  So what I'd like to ask you ah, [E.], is that ah, is, what you can relate to me about ah, an incident that happened early this morning.  ET               Yeah.  After the statement was completed, E.T. and C.T. were driven back to their home where E.T. produced a knife and the keys to the driver's cab.  C.T. was told that she was through, and that E.T. would remain in police custody.  Constable Logan then took E.T. to visit the scene of the crime after which they returned to the police station.  Following the appellant's request, he had an interview in person with his lawyer which lasted half an hour.  The next morning, the appellant telephoned Constable Logan and said he remembered some things he had forgotten the day before and wished to add them to his statement.  When the Constable arrived at the police station, he found the appellant engaged in a telephone conversation with his lawyer which ended shortly thereafter.  When Logan sat down with the appellant, they again went through the filling out of the \"Statement to Person in Authority\" form and E.T. indicated without prompting that he did not wish to speak to anyone other than Constable Logan or have anyone else present during his statement.  Constable Logan also explained to E.T. that if anyone had offered him any hope of advantage or suggested any fear of prejudice with respect to giving this statement, that E.T. should forget about what they had said.  The second statement was taken over a relatively short period, and after covering the topics which E.T. had apparently mentioned over the phone, reverted to a discussion of what the youths' plan with respect to the cab driver had been.  The second statement included the following exchange:  Q.               . . . What was the complete plan?  A.[A.] was gonna sit behind the driver and stab him in the neck. . . . I was supposed to sit in the passenger side in the front and just stab when ah . . . [L.I.R.] and [Allen] were to hold the guns to his head.  The same statement also included the following question and answer:  Q.. . . Was everyone aware and in agreement with the plan to kill the taxi driver?  A.[A.] and [L.] were, Mike and I were I don't know, wondering I guess.  As mentioned above, the trial judge excluded the first statement but admitted the second, and convicted E.T. of second degree murder.  The appellant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, seeking to have the second statement excluded, and if successful, he claimed that he would be entitled to an acquittal on the ground that the evidence established his innocence as a principal, and that there was no evidence to support his conviction as an aider or abettor under s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the appeal. ",

        "Facts": " The respondent was a family physician practising in Edmonton.  The respondent was charged with 14 counts of sexual assault involving seven complainants who were his patients at all relevant times.  The assaults were alleged to have occurred while the complainants attended at the respondent's office for medical treatment and diagnosis.  Each of the complainants consented to being touched in intimate areas of her body but that consent was predicated upon the touching being carried out for valid medical purposes.  Prior to trial, the respondent applied for an order that each of the counts alleged against him be tried separately.  He requested in the alternative that the counts be severed by complainant.  McDonald J., who was not the trial judge, heard the application.  He did not order a separate trial for each count, but instead ordered that three different trials be held depending on the part of the complainant's body that was involved in the assault.  McDonald J. ordered one trial for allegations involving the complainants' genitalia, a second trial for allegations concerning the complainants' breasts, and a third trial for any other matters.  This resulted in an order that not only severed but also divided counts, such that separate trials were to be held for events that occurred within one visit to the respondent's office by the same complainant.  The respondent elected to be tried by judge alone.  The Crown proceeded to trial first on those counts relating to vaginal examinations (nine counts in total), and sought to have the admissibility of the evidence relating to the severed counts determined at avoir direat the outset of the trial.  Hope J., the trial judge, refused to hold avoir direand ruled that the Crown could proceed by calling all of the evidence relating to the severed counts, subject to a subsequent ruling on admissibility.  The Crown called all of the evidence relating to the severed counts, as well as the evidence of the complainants in the trial going to the counts before the court and the evidence of two medical experts.  After avoir direduring the trial, the trial judge admitted the evidence of the police officer who testified to the respondent's statement to the police.  After anothervoir dire, the trial judge refused to admit the evidence of several other women who stated on thevoir direthat they had experienced similar assaults by the respondent.  He also refused to admit the testimony of the respondent's ranking medical officer as to counselling the respondent had received from her after complaints were lodged against the respondent while he practised in the military.  The trial judge subsequently ruled all the evidence relating to the severed counts inadmissible as irrelevant or, even if relevant, too prejudicial.  At the close of the Crown's case, the respondent brought a motion for a non-suit.  The trial judge granted the application and the respondent was acquitted.  The Crown's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (1992), 120 A.R. 391, and this Court granted leave to appeal.

W.(D.),[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at p. 758.  When read as a whole, it can be seen that the charge is eminently fair.  Although it is not determinative, it is significant that the Crown made no objection at trial to this aspect of the charge.  Indeed, as the Court of Appeal observed it is doubtful that this direction, if it stood alone, would justify the granting of a new trial.  A review of the directions makes it crystal clear that the jury was instructed to consider the evidence as a whole and not in piecemeal fashion.  Indeed in dealing with the circumstantial evidence, it is significant that the trial judge instructed the jury to consider that evidence in the context of the Crown and defence theories and in relation to the evidence as a whole.  The following are examples of the instructions to the jury which were eminently sound and correct in dealing with the evidence: ",

        "Facts": " The accused, Imre Finta, was born in Kolozsvar, Hungary (now a part of Romania) in 1912.  During the 1930s, he lived and studied law in Szeged, Hungary.  In 1935, Mr. Finta enrolled in the Royal Hungarian Military Academy and in January 1939 he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie.  The Gendarmerie is most accurately described as an armed paramilitary police force which served the Hungarian government by wielding political muscle in the country's more rural areas.  By 1942, Mr. Finta had achieved the rank of captain in this notorious organization.  In March 1944, Mr. Finta was posted to Szeged as commander of the investigative subdivision of the Gendarmerie.  That same month Hungary had been occupied by the forces of the Third Reich.  Despite the fact that Hungary had joined the Axis powers in 1940, Germany proceeded to install an even more pro-German puppet government in the Hungarian capital of Budapest.  Thus, throughout the relevant period, Hungary was ade factooccupied state.  The Hungarian police and the Gendarmerie came under the direct command of the German SS, and these two organizations were instrumental in administering the anti-Jewish laws adopted by the Nazi government of Germany and the Hungarian government under its control.  The charges against Mr. Finta stem from his time in Szeged.  Mr. Finta is alleged to have been in charge of the \"de-jewification\" of Szeged during the spring of 1944.  This activity was authorized by the so-called \"Baky Order\", the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior Order passed on April 7, 1944.  In its essentials, the \"Baky Order\" called for the isolation, complete expropriation, ghettoization, concentration, entrainment, and eventual deportation (primarily to Auschwitz and Birkenau) of all Hungarian Jews.  Once there, these Jews faced either immediate extermination or forced labour followed by eventual extermination.  The events at Szeged were duplicated in villages and towns across Hungary throughout that unfortunate spring.  There can be no doubt that this process, which my colleague, Justice Cory, has described in all its horrific detail, was an integral part of what the Nazis themselves dubbed the \"final solution\" to the \"Jewish problem\", namely the systematic slaughter of every last European Jew.  In 1947-48, Mr. Finta was tried and convicted,in absentia, by a Szeged court for \"crimes against the people\" relating to his role as a Gendarmerie captain during the spring of 1944 purge of Szeged's Jewish population.  In 1951, Finta immigrated to Canada.  In 1956 he became a Canadian citizen, and has lived in this country ever since.  Mr. Finta was charged with unlawful confinement, robbery, kidnapping and manslaughter of 8,617 Jews between May 16 and June 30, 1944 at or about Szeged, Hungary, thereby committing an offence under the definitions of these crimes in theCriminal Codeexisting at the time the offences were committed.  The indictment added that such offences constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes under what is nows. 7(3.71)of theCriminal Code.  The latter reference was added because prosecution for crimes committed abroad cannot ordinarily take place in Canada since criminal offences are generally confined to conduct that takes place in Canada (s. 6 of theCode), and the conduct alleged here took place in Hungary.  Section 7(3.71), however, permits prosecution for conduct outside Canada if such conduct constitutes a crime against humanity or a war crime and would have been a crime in Canada at the time it took place had it been committed here.  As Cory J. states, the principal issue in this case concerns a proper understanding of this and related provisions permitting persons to be prosecuted in Canada for crimes against Canadian law if these crimes also constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes under international law.  My colleague has set forth the judicial history of the case and I need not repeat it except as may be necessary in setting forth my views.  For the moment, it suffices to set forth the basic procedural steps in the proceedings.  Following a pre-trial motion before the late Callaghan A.C.J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, to consider a number of constitutional issues regarding the validity of the legislation under theCharter, a trial was held before Campbell J. sitting with a jury.  The accused was acquitted and the acquittal was affirmed by a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dubin C.J. and the late Tarnopolsky J.A. dissenting.  From that decision, the Crown appealed to this Court, raising seven grounds of appeal.

        "Facts": " The appellants were among some 80 individuals simultaneously arrested on January 22, 1985 after the culmination of a police investigation into the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs by members of two motorcycle clubs.  The Crown initially laid a single information against 61 individuals charging them with conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD.  A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 2, 1985.  However, in November 1985 the Honourable John Crosbie, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, preferred two indictments, replacing the original information and cancelling the preliminary hearing.  One indictment was presented in the Supreme Court of Ontario and named 12 accused.  The other indictment was presented in the District Court of Ontario and named 27 accused including the appellants.  The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were jointly charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine between October 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  The appellant Jeffreys was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine between June 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  The trial in the Supreme Court of Ontario proceeded first.  It began on June 2, 1986 before Bowlby J.  Verdicts were rendered on February 27, 1987.  The appellants and seven other accused were tried in the District Court of Ontario before Judge O'Connell and a jury.  That trial began on May 11, 1987.  Pre-trial motions were heard throughout May, June and September.  Verdicts were rendered on June 11, 1988.  The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were convicted of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine.  The appellant Jeffreys was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  The evidence against the appellants consisted of testimony from informant witnesses, results of physical surveillance and recordings of telephone conversations.  One of the pre-trial motions entertained by the trial judge was a \"Wilson\" motion (named after the decision of this Court inWilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594) in which the appellants challenged the validity of seven wiretap authorizations which permitted the police to intercept their telephone conversations.  The impugned authorizations were granted by Judge Scott of the District Court of Ontario.  Two other authorizations were granted by Trainor and Ewaschuk JJ., both of the Supreme Court of Ontario.  Prior to theWilsonhearing, the trial judge ordered the packets containing the material filed in support of all the authorizations to be opened.  He then stated his intention to remove the affidavits from the sealed packet and edit them.  He explained that after editing the affidavits himself he would give a copy of the edited affidavits to the Crown to determine if further editing needed to be done.  He would then give copies to counsel for the various accused and hear any \"suggestions\" they had about the affidavits.  After the adjournment, the trial judge indicated that he had read each affidavit in light of the decision inParmar.  He claimed to have edited the affidavits \"only insofar as they contain information from informants and others which is to be protected, and insofar as they contain summary or opinion\".  He then proceeded to review the edited affidavits with the Crown, who suggested a few additional deletions.  In a few instances the Crown indicated that material edited by the trial judge could be disclosed.  These suggestions were adopted by the trial judge.  The accused and their counsel were present throughout this exercise.  The trial judge then proposed to distribute the edited affidavits to counsel.  However, before this took place, counsel for the appellant Farinacci made a submission requesting \"all information contained in these affidavits, other than the specific name and identifying address, or the like of anybody who purports to be in the position of an informant or informer, as the case may be\".  The Crown argued that this submission was premature.  The trial judge agreed.  At that point counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested clarification of the procedure which the trial judge intended to follow.   He specifically asked whether the appellants would \"have some input to request further information from the affidavits\".  The trial judge made it clear that the next step in the process was that the defence would receive copies of the edited affidavits and then the actualWilsonhearing would proceed.  Once the edited affidavits were distributed to counsel, but before reviewing them, counsel for the appellant Farinacci, relying heavily on the decision inParmar, re-asserted the right of the defence to the deleted information.  Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested an indication of the basis upon which the deletions were made.  The trial judge then suggested that every deletion met all four criteria set out inParmar.  However, he also stated that in one or two cases he had deleted some \"commentary\".  After counsel were given an opportunity to review the edited affidavits, counsel for the appellant Farinacci again attempted to make submissions regarding the deletions that had been made.  Counsel pointed out that the deletions made by the trial judge went beyond those which were made from the same affidavits by Bowlby J.  The trial judge characterized the deletions which had been made by Bowlby J. as \"irrelevant\" to what he was doing.  Counsel for the appellant Farinacci then asked about a specific deletion from one of the affidavits, asking if it was appropriate to inquire into whether his client's name appeared in the deleted materials and in what context.  The trial judge indicated that it was not appropriate for him to inquire, stating that the deletion was made \"in the interests of the persons involved\" and that all the deletions he made \"were strictly related to informants, and one or two other minor deletions which related to commentary...\".  Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys stated that the defence were, at leastprima facie, entitled to all information reflecting on the reasonable and probable grounds upon which the authorizations were granted.  The trial judge flatly rejected this submission.  The Crown submitted that \"[t]he accused are entitled to know if they are named in the deleted portions.\"  The trial judge then proceeded to list those accused named in the deleted portions of the nine affidavits.  Defence counsel was also advised that no confidential sources had died, were potential Crown witnesses or were police officers.  At theWilsonhearing, the appellants cross-examined the three police officers who swore affidavits in support of the nine authorizations.  The trial judge ruled that defence counsel could not cross-examine the \"sub-affiants\" who supplied information to the affiants.  However, he granted the appellants leave to call two additional police officers as witnesses.  On June 24, 1987 the trial judge dismissed the application to set aside the seven District Court authorizations.  Shortly after this hearing, the appellants brought an application before Watt J. to set aside the two Supreme Court authorizations.  Watt J. edited the affidavits filed in support of these authorizations less extensively than O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. had edited the same affidavits before distributing them to defence counsel.  Ultimately, Watt J. dismissed the application to set aside these two authorizations.  The appellants also brought a motion to quash O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s rulings and sought prohibition in the Supreme Court of Ontario in order to prevent him from admitting, in his capacity as trial judge, primary evidence obtained from the seven impugned District Court authorizations.  This motion was heard and dismissed by Watt J. on September 10, 1987:R. v. Durette(1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126.  No appeal was taken from this decision.  The appellants appealed their convictions to the Court of Appealinter aliain respect of the validity of the wiretap authorizations and the admissibility and use of the recordings intercepted pursuant thereto.  On May 15, 1992, the Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal:R. v. Durette (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 557, 54 O.A.C. 81, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421.  The appellants appeal to this Court as of right pursuant tos. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. ",

            "In a ruling on a voir dire with respect to the admissibility of the evidence obtained during the search under a warrant issued pursuant to s. 487  of the Criminal Code , Millward J. held that the s. 8 rights of the respondent had been violated and excluded the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Millward J. found that the premises searched constituted a \"dwelling‑house\" within the meaning of s. 12  NCA and concluded that the proper course of action would have been for the officers to seek a warrant pursuant to that section rather than under the Criminal Code  provisions.  Although he found that the wording of s. 487(1), which allows for issuance of a search warrant with regard to \"a building, receptacle or place\", was broad enough to encompass a dwelling‑house, Millward J. concluded that where the offence suspected to have been committed was one under the NCA, the specific statutory provisions for a warrant pursuant to that Act ought to be followed.  On that basis, he held that the warrant under which the search had been conducted was invalid.",

Multiform Manufacturing Co., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 624, as not intending such a conclusion.  As such, he found that the search warrants were invalidly issued.",

        "Facts": " The respondent, David Grant, was acquitted of charges of unlawful cultivation of marihuana and possession of marihuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 6(1) and 4(2)NCA.  The acquittal resulted from the exclusion from evidence of a number of items seized during a search conducted under a warrant issued pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code.  The basis for exclusion was that statements made in the information sworn in order to ground the warrant request included information obtained during warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent.  The trial judge found these warrantless searches to be in violation ofs. 8of theCharter.  In a routine roadblock check conducted on April 29, 1989, a truck driven by the respondent, who purported to reside in an apartment in Victoria, British Columbia, was found to contain a number of items consistent with a marihuana growing operation.  On May 23, 1989, a police officer had received information from what he claimed to be a previously reliable but confidential informant that at the time of the roadblock, the respondent had been on his way to set up a marihuana growing operation and that he was part of an organization cultivating marihuana on south Vancouver Island.  The police later conducted two warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent, a two‑storey building at 11110 Trillium Place, Sidney, British Columbia.  On September 7, 1989, two officers entered onto the property looking for signs of marihuana cultivation.  During a search of the perimeter, they observed several things which would have been impossible to have observed without entering onto the property.  They noted covered windows on the lower floor, heard what they described as the sound of electric motors or fans emanating from inside the residence and noticed two air vents which looked recently installed.  Later that day, the police observed the respondent leave the Trillium Place residence and followed him to an apartment in Victoria.  On September 20, 1989, the respondent was observed carrying what appeared to be fertilizer or weed sprayer from the Victoria apartment to the Trillium Place residence.  On September 21, 1989, two police officers conducted a second perimeter search of the Trillium Place property and noted that the basement windows appeared to be sealed with plastic and were wet with condensation.  The police officers testified, and it was admitted by the respondent, that they had reasonable grounds to believe that the Trillium Place residence constituted a dwelling‑house which contained a narcotic in respect of or by means of which a narcotics offence had been committed, prior to the first entry onto the property.  Further, the police conducted inquiries of B.C. Hydro and were able to determine that recent electrical consumption at the Trillium Place property had been unusually high compared with other similar area residences.  Based on an information that included the pieces of information gleaned in May, 1989, the inquiries made of B.C. Hydro, as well as the observations made during the two warrantless perimeter searches, on September 22, 1989 the R.C.M.P. obtained search warrants pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code.  These warrants authorized \"peace officers\" to search the Trillium Place address and the Victoria apartment.  The respondent was arrested at his business, advised of his rights and given copies of the warrants.  On execution of the warrants, the police discovered 80 plants which were later identified as marihuana, a variety of growing equipment at the Trillium Place address and a small amount of marihuana, drug‑related paraphernalia and documents at the Victoria apartment.  The respondent was acquitted of the charges referred to above when the evidence obtained in the searches and seizures was excluded by reason of a violation ofs. 8of theCharter. ",

        "Facts": " The respondent was charged with indecent assault of his niece contrary to s. 149(1) (now repealed) and with having sexual intercourse with her when she was under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 146(1) (now s. 153(1)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The complainant was 16 years old at the time of the trial.  She testified that the respondent had resided at her parents' home in the summer of 1982 for one or two months when she was eight years old and that, on one occasion, while her parents were away for a weekend with their van club, she was left alone in the care of the respondent.  On both nights during the absence of her parents, the respondent sexually assaulted her while she was in bed.  The complainant further testified that about one week before the \"van club weekend\", the respondent had sexually assaulted her while her mother was asleep.  She described the last assault as having taken place a few months later, when the respondent was no longer staying at her parents' house and her aunt came to baby-sit.  The complainant, who first spoke of these sexual assaults in 1989 when she was 15 years old, initially reported that the sexual assaults had occurred in 1980.  An information was drafted and the respondent was arrested on August 11, 1989.  After being cautioned and given his right to counsel, the respondent made several inculpatory statements to the arresting officers.  At the time of his arrest, the respondent was informed by the police that the incidents of which he was being accused had occurred when he was living at the complainant's house.  The information sworn on the day of the respondent's arrest described the period of the alleged assaults as being between January 1, 1980 and January 1, 1981.  However, after the preliminary inquiry, the information was amended, on consent, to allege that the incidents had occurred between January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983.  At trial, the complainant testified that all the incidents had occurred in 1982, stating that she and her mother had gone through old photographs which had helped them determine the relevant time frame.  The complainant's mother was also called by the Crown and she testified that the respondent had lived with the family for two months in the summer of 1982, and that the respondent had baby-sat her daughter during a van trip to Rochester, New York, in July of 1982.  The Crown closed its case and the trial was adjourned to accommodate the defence, which had not received disclosure of oral inculpatory statements made by the respondent to the police.  Prior to adjourning, defence counsel stated in open court that he would be calling three witnesses, including an alibi witness, and the Crown indicated the defence's undertaking to provide him with the particulars of the alibi evidence.  When the trial resumed approximately five weeks later, the Crown applied to reopen its case and recall the complainant's mother with respect to new evidence pertaining to the dates of the offences.  Over the defence's objection, he was permitted to do so.  The mother testified that she had been mistaken as to the year in which the respondent stayed with the family, and that she now realized the proper time frame was the summer of 1983, not the summer of 1982.  The alibi evidence was to have been that the respondent had been confined to a hospital during the relevant time period in the summer of 1982.  The Crown then moved to have the indictment amended to extend the period during which the sexual assaults were alleged to have occurred to include the year 1983.  Over the defence's objection, leave to amend was granted and the time frame described in the indictment became January 1, 1982 to January 1, 1984.  After a further adjournment, the respondent was called and he testified that he had lived with the complainant's family during the summer of 1983.  The respondent was found guilty of indecent assault and of having sexual intercourse with his niece when she was under the age of 14.  The Court of Appeal, however, allowed the respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and entered an acquittal: (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 424, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 121, 13 C.R. (4th) 302, 54 O.A.C. 62.  The Crown appeals to this Court only in respect of the acquittal entered on count two (the charge of sexual intercourse contrary to s. 146(1)), and not with respect to count one (the charge of indecent assault contrary to s. 149(1)).  This is because the amendment to the indictment resulted in a time frame which extended beyond the point when s. 149(1) was still in force.

(2d) 267, and by this Court, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956.  Since the earlier judgment of this Court sets out the facts in detail, I will only give a brief description of the murder.  On the night of September 18 to 19, 1976 the appellant met the victim, Mary Frances McKenna, in a bar in Toronto.  Apparently the pair left the bar about midnight on their way to the victim's apartment.  The attack which followed was one of unspeakable brutality.  The appellant stabbed the victim 132 times using five different knives.  The force used was such that some of the knives were broken at the time the police located them.  In the course of the first two years of his sentence the appellant committed various disciplinary offences connected with smuggling and an attempted escape.  Apparently when he was placed in punitive segregation for the latter offence he underwent a complete change of heart and became a \"model prisoner\".  In 1983 he was transferred to a medium security institution and then in 1990 to a minimum security institution.  During his confinement in these various penal institutions the appellant became involved in various charitable or religious groups.  He participated in work programs in the institutions.  Since 1988 he has received several permits for escorted temporary absences.  At various times he took part in Alcoholics Anonymous activities.  He also participated in some training sessions and requested the assistance of a psychologist.

        ],
        "Facts": " The Crown's case against the appellant relied primarily upon police surveillance of the appellant and an alleged co-conspirator, Alejandro Manolio.  The trial judge found that the police surveillance evidence of June 17, 1989 did not advance the Crown's case, but that the surveillance evidence of June 19, 20, and 28, 1989, and of July 3 to 7, 1989, established a relationship between the appellant and Manolio.  There was further surveillance evidence which showed an association between the appellant and two men, Zevallos and Narvaez.  Part of this evidence was that on July 7, 1989, the appellant and Manolio drove in a Mazda registered in the name of Zevallos to a school lot and then parked behind a Mustang a short distance from the lot.  Narvaez, who was a passenger in the Mustang, approached the appellant and Manolio.  The appellant, after a short conversation with Narvaez, went to the passenger side of the Mazda and took out a white plastic bag.  He handed the bag to Narvaez, who then got into a Toyota.  The police followed and stopped the Toyota.  The other occupant of the Toyota, Zevallos, was at that time found in possession of one kilogram of cocaine and $4,200 in Canadian money.  The cocaine was contained in a bag which, at least on the surface, did not appear to be similar to the package handed to Narvaez by the appellant.  The police arrested the appellant later on July 7, 1989.  The appellant was found upon his arrest to have approximately $306,000 in cash in the trunk of the car he was driving.  At the same time the police searched an Oldsmobile Toronado (which the appellant had been observed driving on July 3, 1989), and found 15 kilograms of cocaine.  The evidence indicated that Manolio had more frequent contact with this car than had the appellant.  The evidence disclosed that on a number of occasions from April to July 1989, the appellant was in possession of large amounts of Canadian currency, which he was exchanging for U.S. currency and Swiss francs.  The total amount of currency that the appellant was shown to have handled over this period was in excess of $700,000 Canadian.  The Crown's theory was that Manolio was the person who did the actual trafficking in narcotics and that the appellant handled the money.  The appellant called evidence at trial in an attempt to explain the large amounts of cash he had handled over the period in question.  It was claimed that the appellant and his brother, who lives in Argentina, were conducting a currency exchange business.  The appellant's brother testified that this business involved buying Argentinean money with U.S. dollars on the Argentinean black market, then using the Argentinean money to purchase Canadian dollars on the black market, and finally shipping the Canadian money to Canada to be exchanged for U.S. dollars.  The appellant's brother stated that the difference between the value of Canadian and U.S. currency on the Argentinean black market would result in this type of circular exchange yielding a substantial profit, a claim supported by the expert testimony of an economist.  The appellant also called as witnesses a relative who testified to having acted on one occasion as a courier of Canadian currency between Argentina and Canada for the appellant and his brother, and an Argentinean who testified to having lent $400,000 U.S. to the appellant's brother.  The appellant did not testify.  The appellant's trial was conducted intermittently over 20 days from November 16, 1989 to July 3, 1990.  At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the appellant moved to have the charges dismissed on the basis that the Crown had failed to adduce any evidence to prove the essential elements of the offences.  The trial judge dismissed that motion on April 2, 1990.  In the course of his oral reasons for denying the motion, the trial judge commented upon having difficulty dealing with the case because of the intermittent nature of the trial proceedings and that he had to rely entirely on his notes.  Three months later, on July 3, 1990, the trial judge delivered judgment with oral reasons.  In rendering his verdict the trial judge again commented on the sporadic nature of the proceedings but his comments did not indicate that he had the same difficulty in dealing with the evidence as he had in April.  The trial judge said he had seriously considered declaring a mistrial because the trial proceedings were \"extremely unsatisfactory\", but that he had decided not to declare a mistrial because that would cause undue hardship to the appellant.  The trial judge then convicted the appellant on the conspiracy, trafficking and possession of narcotics charges, and acquitted him on the proceeds-related charges.  On July 25, 1990, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to nine years' imprisonment.  In considering the trial judge's decision to acquit the appellant on the proceeds-related charges, it is helpful to divide the proceeds-related charges into separate groups based on the time periods involved.  The proceeds-related charges against the appellant were counts 6 to 24 on the information dated November 16, 1989.  Counts 6 to 11 and 22 involved allegations of unlawful possession of the proceeds of narcotic trafficking, and of laundering the proceeds of narcotic trafficking, between April 28, 1989 and May 24, 1989 (\"the pre-July counts\").   Counts 12 to 21 and 24 involved allegations of similar illegal conduct by the appellant in early July 1989 (\"the July counts\").  Finally, count 23 alleged the appellant had been in unlawful possession of the proceeds of narcotic trafficking between April 28, 1989 and July 6, 1989 (\"the global count\").

        "Facts": " Scott Jones had a history of sexual assault.  On May 28, 1982 he was convicted of rape, attempted rape and gross indecency for incidents involving young girls aged 10, 12 and 13.  When the police sought to arrest Jones for these incidents, he confronted them with a loaded shotgun for which he was convicted of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.  Jones was sentenced to five years in prison for these incidents.  On November 25, 1985, Jones was released under parole.  On October 24, 1986, Jones sexually assaulted a 26-year-old woman, having forced her into his car and confined her there.  Jones was alleged to have committed a sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl on October 26, 1986.  On November 5, one day after being questioned for the earlier sexual assaults, Jones sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl at knife point.  On November 7, Jones was charged with three counts of sexual assault with a weapon (contrary to s. 246.2 of theCriminal Code) and three counts of unlawful confinement (contrary to s. 247(2) of theCode).  On November 18, 1986, the appellant's lawyer requested that he be remanded for observation to determine if he was mentally ill.  In particular, the appellant's counsel requested the order to determine whether the appellant was fit to stand trial, was sane at the time of the alleged offences and to gain some insight into the appellant for the purpose of sentencing.  He was so remanded pursuant to s. 465(1)(c)(iii) of theCode.  A 30-day remand order was issued \"for purposes of medical and/or psychiatric observation\".  Two psychiatrists and one psychologist examined the appellant at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute.  Prior to the first examination, Dr. Lohrasbe warned the appellant that none of the discussions would be confidential and that all information that was provided could be used against the appellant in the course of the proceedings.  A second psychiatrist, Dr. Semrau, also examined the appellant and warned him that the interview was not confidential and could be used against him in court.  He also advised the appellant of his right to talk to counsel.  The psychologist, Dr. La Torre, warned the appellant prior to his interview with him that anything he said could be used in a court of law.  Although the trial judge found that the appellant was adequately warned that his discussions with the psychiatrists could be used against him, he was not specifically warned that the evidence of the psychiatrists could be used to assist in determining whether or not he was a dangerous offender.  In the course of assessing the appellant's mental health, Dr. Lohrasbe became concerned about the appellant's potential for future violence.  These concerns emerged from Mr. Jones himself who stated during the examination that he was a danger to potential victims.  Although Dr. Lohrasbe considered the implications of the use of this evidence at the dangerous offender stage, he did not fundamentally alter his method of interviewing.  While he administered a slightly different intelligence test (using a more widely accepted version), the focus of the testing was identical to the one to determine the state of Jones' mental health.  The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault with a weapon.  During the dangerous offender proceedings that followed, the trial judge conducted avoir direin which the appellant challenged the admissibility of the evidence from the three doctors at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute on the grounds that to admit this evidence would breach hiss. 7Charterrights.  The trial judge found that the evidence was admissible in spite of the fact that additional warnings had not been given to the appellant about the possible use of this psychiatric testimony in dangerous offender proceedings.  Dr. Lohrasbe found that the appellant was extremely dangerous and he could see no basis for a change in this psychological make-up in the foreseeable future.  He concluded that placing the appellant in the community would put other young women at risk.  Dr. La Torre found that the appellant had considerable hostility toward women and that his lack of insight into his problem created a strong risk that he would re-offend.  Dr. Semrau found that the appellant's sexual assault tendency followed a very dangerous pattern that was highly likely to repeat itself in the future.  The two doctors testifying on behalf of the appellant accepted the deep-seated nature of the appellant's problems.  However, they were of the view that treatment over the normal period of detention could prevent the appellant from re-offending.  The trial judge concluded that the appellant was dangerous within the meaning of theCode.

            "I.                        Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. -- The important question in this appeal is very similar to the main question raised in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, heard together with this appeal, namely, are persons separately charged with an offence, and persons suspected of an offence, compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and criminal trials of other persons charged with the same offence?",
            "III.               The primary appellants are:  Paul Ominayak, Reinie Jobin, Victor Scotty, Dwight Gladue, Norman Laboucan, Brian Laboucan, Sullivan Laboucan, John Sawan, Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George Whitehead, John Letendre and Steve Noskey.  All thirteen are charged with several criminal offences, namely: arson, mischief, possession of explosives, and wearing a mask in the commission of an indictable offence.",
            "XVII.          Finally, Berger J. refused to assess the constitutionality of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .  He noted that the applicants had failed to challenge ss. 698 , 699 , or 700  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , pursuant to which the subpoenas were issued.  Also, he noted that no evidence had been called to demonstrate that questions posed might tend to incriminate the subpoenaed witnesses.  He concluded, \"[o]nce again, the context has yet to be revealed\" (p. 288).",
            "XX.             The Court of Appeal examined cases cited by the appellants, but noted that \"the appellants' application for an order quashing the subpoenas in this case was made under s. 24(1) [of the Charter ]\" (p. 447).  The court then followed R. v. Paquette (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Alta. C.A.), where Stevenson J.A. found that, although provincial superior courts are courts of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of s. 24(1)  of the Charter , an appeal will lie to a court of appeal only if the Criminal Code  so provides (where proceedings are criminal in nature) or where the proceeding is a prerogative one.",
            "XXI.            The Court of Appeal held that, in respect of Berger J.'s refusal to quash the subpoenas, the proceeding was clearly criminal in nature, since the subpoenas were issued under the authority of the Criminal Code .  In so far as the Criminal Code  provides no right of appeal, and in so far as no prerogative relief was sought, the court held that the appellants had no right of appeal.",
            "Again the appellants do not have the right to appeal from this decision.  This proceeding in so far as it relates to this issue is clearly criminal in nature.  The concern of the appellants is that as a result of s. 5, witnesses may incriminate themselves.  The appellants did not seek any relief other than a declaration that s. 5 was inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter , and therefore of no force or effect under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  There is nothing in the Criminal Code  or in the Charter  which gives them the right to appeal from a refusal to grant a declaration.",
            "2.Are persons separately charged with an offence, and persons suspected of an offence, compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and criminal trials of other persons charged with the same offence, or would compellability in this context violate s. 7  of the Charter ?",
            "XXVIII.      For third parties to a criminal proceeding, the type of recourse to seek is dictated by the court issuing the order.  A provincial court order should be challenged by an application to a superior court for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.    This decision can then be appealed pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  A superior court order can be challenged by seeking leave to appeal directly to this Court pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .",
            "XXIX.         The order at issue in this appeal is the issuance of subpoenas to the appellants by the Alberta Provincial Court.  The Court of Appeal for Alberta rejected the appeal launched by the appellants pursuant to s. 813  of the Criminal Code , because of a lack of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  The Court cited the absence of a statutory right of appeal in the Criminal Code  as fatal to the appellants' application.  It is significant that the Court of Appeal considered that the appellants had in essence made an application for relief based solely on s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  It based this finding on the fact that the appellants had effectively abandoned their application for prohibition, by not pleading it before Berger J., and that Berger J. had based his decision solely on s. 24(1)  of the Charter .",
            "XXX.          In the light of its finding that the present application was made solely pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter , the Court of Appeal held that no right of appeal lay from the decision of Berger J.  Neither the Criminal Code , nor the Charter  (as interpreted in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863) provide for such a right.  As such, the Court of Appeal decided it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.",
            "XXXII.        Given that the order in question emanates from a provincial court, the proper procedure to follow, as laid out in Dagenais, is to apply to a superior court judge for the issuance of a writ of certiorari.  As noted in Dagenais, an immediate appeal becomes possible from an order refusing to grant certiorari through the operation of s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .",
            "XXXIII.      As in Primeau, we are faced with a situation where the appellants have not technically complied with the procedures set out in Dagenais.  In our view, however, the jurisdictional question can be resolved in much the same way and for the same reasons as it was solved in Primeau.  Given that neither the appellants, nor the Court of Appeal had the benefit of this Court's reasons in Dagenais, we find that it is sufficient that the appellants applied for s. 24(1)  Charter  relief, which by its nature would be included in the expanded remedial scope of certiorari described in Dagenais.  The Court of Appeal therefore did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The jurisdiction of this Court follows naturally from the decision of the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  and there is no need to examine the alternative jurisdictional grounds on which leave to appeal was granted.",
            "B.Are persons separately charged with an offence, and persons suspected of an offence, compellable as witnesses at the preliminary inquiries and criminal trials of other persons charged with the same offence, or would compellability in this context violate s. 7  of the Charter ?",
            "XXXVI.      The relief they sought, however, was not properly available to them.  The appellants claimed a right to silence on the basis that they were entitled to claim this right by virtue of a status, namely, \"accused person\", \"suspected person\", or \"unindicted co-conspirator\".  This focus on status occludes the focus required by the Charter , which is a focus on the purpose or character of the proceedings.  Thus, the fact that some of the appellants were not accused of anything at the time of their application is not of primary importance.  It also follows from the reasons in S. (R.J.), as elaborated on in British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, released concurrently, and Primeau, supra, that there is no meaningful difference between subpoenas issued in respect of preliminary inquiries and those issued in respect of Jobin's criminal trial.  Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a form of pre-trial interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable, such that a different analysis might have obtained for the reasons expressed in S. (R.J.) and further elaborated on in Branch.",
            "I.                 I say at the outset, as my colleagues point out and as my concurring reasons in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, make clear, that the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" appellants, to use my colleagues' terminology, are compellable witnesses at each other's preliminary inquiries and criminal trials.  However, if compelled to testify, they are entitled to the protection of s. 13  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , which, like my colleagues, I find does not infringe the Charter .  In addition, should the circumstances be of the kind I outlined in my concurring reasons in S. (R.J.), the appellants could invoke the residual protection of s. 7  of the Charter .  I agree, though, with my colleagues that \"there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a form of pre-trial interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable\" (p. 93).  Accordingly, I find that at this stage, the subpoena stage, none of the appellants could successfully invoke the residual protection of s. 7 outlined in my reasons in S. (R.J.) to quash their subpoenas.  As I emphasized in S. (R.J.), it will be rare indeed that the residual protection of s. 7 could be successfully invoked at the subpoena stage.  In this respect, I agree with Berger J., who dealt with the appellants' first application to quash subpoenas, when he stated:  \"[i]t would be dangerous. . . to now predict what evidence will be elicited from each applicant\" and \"I prefer the view that there can be no breach until the proposed witness has testified\" ((1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at p. 286)."
        ],
        "Facts": " II.The facts of the present appeal are complex.  The appellants are all either charged or suspects in connection with an explosion and fire that damaged property located at the Buchanan Logging Site, near Haig Lake, Alberta.  For the purposes of identification within this appeal, we shall refer to the appellants charged with an offence as the \"primary appellants\";  those who are only suspects shall be referred to as \"secondary appellants\".  III.The primary appellants are:  Paul Ominayak, Reinie Jobin, Victor Scotty, Dwight Gladue, Norman Laboucan, Brian Laboucan, Sullivan Laboucan, John Sawan, Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George Whitehead, John Letendre and Steve Noskey.  All thirteen are charged with several criminal offences, namely: arson, mischief, possession of explosives, and wearing a mask in the commission of an indictable offence.  IV.The secondary appellants, who are not now charged but who are said to be implicated in the offence and who are in receipt of subpoenas to testify, are:  Rodney Sinclair, Adolphus Wapoose, Gary Wapoose, Joe Laboucan, Mark Laboucan and Dennis Noskey.  V.The Crown has conceded that there is but oneactus reusalleged.  However, each of the primary appellants is the subject of a separate information, with the exception of Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George Whitehead, John Letendre and Steve Noskey, who are jointly charged.  The Crown sought and obtained from the Alberta Provincial Court, subpoenas requiring Norman Laboucan, Brian Laboucan, Victor Scotty, Sullivan Laboucan, Joe Laboucan, Gary Wapoose, Adolphus Wapoose, Mark Laboucan and Rodney Sinclair to testify at the preliminary inquiry of Reinie Jobin.  Reinie Jobin was subpoenaed to testify at John Sawan's preliminary inquiry.  VI.The appellants applied for relief to Berger J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta.  Although the exact nature of the application is unclear, the original notice of motion requested,inter alia:  1.To quash subpoenas as annexed hereto in Schedule \"A\" setting out the witnesses subpoenaed and the respective Preliminary Inquiries for which they are to be compelled and such other subpoenas as have been served upon and of the Applicants by the time of the hearing of this application;  2.In the nature of prohibition preventing the presiding Judge at the said Preliminary Inquiries of:  a) Reinie Jobin and b) John Sawan from compelling the evidence of the Applicants at those Preliminary Inquiries and in the Preliminary Inquiries against c) Paul Ominayak and d) Victor Scotty or in Preliminary Inquiries of e) Brian Laboucan; f) Sullivan Laboucan; g) Norman Laboucan; h) Dwight Gladue; and i) Walter Whitehead, Hector Whitehead, George Whitehead, John Letendre, and Steve Noskey;  3.An interim Order of prohibition until such time as this application can be heard and determined;  VII.In addition to seeking to quash the subpoenas, the appellants obtained permission to challenge the validity ofs. 5of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5.  The primary appellants allege that being compelled to testify would violate their right to silence contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  Berger J. dismissed the application without ruling on the validity ofs. 5of theCanada Evidence Act: (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, 123 A.R. 220.  VIII.The appellants appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal for Alberta.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction:  (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 445, 131 A.R. 179, 25 W.A.C. 179, 10 C.R.R. (2d) 313.  IX.In the interim between the decision of Berger J. and that of the Court of Appeal, all of the primary appellants waived their rights to a preliminary inquiry in the hope that an appeal route would be located before any person would be compelled to give evidence.  However, following the dismissal of the appellants' appeal to the Court of Appeal, subpoenas were issued in the trial of Reinie Jobin.  X.Jobin's trial was to begin in October 1992.  All the primary and secondary appellants, save Jobin, were once again subpoenaed to testify.  They applied a second time to the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in order to have the subpoenas quashed.  McFadyen J. (as she then was) dismissed the application on the same grounds as Berger J. did.  XI.Jobin's trial finally began on January 4, 1993.  At the outset of Jobin's trial, defence counsel announced that a police statement made by Jobin could be admitted without avoir dire.  On this basis, the Crown agreed not to call any of the subpoenaed witnesses.  Jobin's counsel later asserted the need for avoir dire.  On March 8, 1993, a mistrial was declared because Crown counsel had referred to Jobin's police statement in the opening address to the jury.  XII.On February 4, 1993, leave to appeal was granted at large by this Court, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vii.  The motion book for leave covered three bases for seeking leave.  First, leave was sought from the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Second, and in the alternative, it was sought directly from the decision of Berger J.  Third, and in the alternative, leave was sought directly from the decision of McFadyen J.

THE COURT:  If the jury have questions before rendering their verdict, we do the best we can to answer them.  If they are necessary prior to your having reached a verdict to have these answered, then we should deal with them now.  If they are questions that are not pertinent to the verdict, then we should have the verdict first and we can have a discussion if you wish afterwards, but if they're pertinent to the verdict then we'd better deal with them now.

        "Facts": " On Sunday, April 14, 1991, the respondent, 43 years old, was hitting golf balls in the soccer field of a school yard in Ottawa.  Eight‑year‑old Tyler Arnold and his friends Joey, Andy and Shawn, entered the school yard, which was about one block away from Tyler Arnold's home, in order to play.  They asked the respondent whether they could catch the balls with their gloves.  The boys had first met the respondent in that same field the previous summer, but only knew him by his first name, John, which was on his key chain.  The boys caught the balls for some time and then some of them went to get refreshments.  Tyler remained in the school yard where the respondent began photographing him.  When two of the other boys, Andy and Joey, returned to the school yard, they had trouble locating the respondent and Tyler.  They found the respondent taking pictures of Tyler in a wooded area at the edge of the school yard.  When the other two boys began to interfere with the picture taking, the respondent asked them several times to leave him and Tyler alone.  Ultimately, the respondent and Tyler ran back out of the wooded area, away from the two other boys.  When Andy and Joey caught up, the respondent said \"Guys, leave us alone\".  Andy agreed to leave them alone if he could steer the respondent's car around the parking lot.  The respondent agreed.  Tyler and Joey sat in the front seat, and, while the respondent operated the gas and break, Andy, sitting on his lap, steered the car.  Soon thereafter the children got out of the car and the respondent told Tyler that they could go to the Champlain Bridge.  One of the children overheard part of this conversation and asked the respondent where he and Tyler were going.  The respondent did not answer.  Although the two children told Tyler not to go with the respondent, Tyler re-entered the car.  The respondent and Tyler drove approximately 2.9 km, stopping at certain points to take pictures along the Ottawa River.  They first drove to the Champlain Bridge where the respondent took photographs of Tyler.  Then, they drove to Kitchissippi Lookout at Westboro Beach where the respondent took more photographs of Tyler positioned on a large rock which juts out into the water of the Ottawa River, including some which feature Tyler on the rock's ledge.  Upon returning home, the other two boys told Joey's mother that Tyler had left in a red car with the respondent, whose name they knew was John and who they had been told lived in an apartment building near the school yard.  As a result, Joey's mother contacted Tyler's father, who, along with the boys, and others (including a police officer) began a search for Tyler which appears to have lasted somewhere between 30 and 90 minutes.  Tyler's father and one of the other boys found Tyler and the respondent at the Kitchissippi Lookout at Westboro  Beach where the respondent was taking pictures of Tyler wearing the respondent's sweater.  Apparently, Tyler had been cold and the respondent had removed his sweater and offered it to Tyler.  Tyler's father demanded to know on what authority the respondent had taken his son, and the respondent replied that he had intended to take pictures of Tyler as a surprise for Tyler's parents.  As a consequence of these events, the respondent was charged with abduction of a person under fourteen years of age (s. 281of theCriminal Code), assault (s. 266 of theCode) and exposing a child to endangerment (s. 218 of theCode).  On August 27, 1991, the respondent entered a plea of not guilty.  On the same day, following the testimony of Tyler, the Crown withdrew the assault charge.  At the close of the Crown's case, counsel for the defence moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the remaining two counts and the court so ordered.  The Crown subsequently appealed the respondent's acquittals and the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal.  The appellant sought and was granted leave to this Court only with regard to the charge under s. 281 of theCode.

        "Facts": " A scuffle occurred outside Rafferty's, a Scarborough bar, at approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 22, 1991.  One of the participants, Theodore Heffern, tried to escape and was chased by a number of individuals, including the appellant.  Heffern ran onto the poorly-lit porch of a neighbouring house.  One member of the pursuing group, Edward Sweeney, followed him onto the porch and began punching and kicking him.  The appellant joined the fracas, and admits to having punched Heffern several times.  When it became apparent that Heffern had been stabbed in the back, the appellant, Sweeney and a number of witnesses fled the scene.  The appellant admitted common assault but denied aggravated assault, and gave evidence that he saw a black man, whom he identified as Jason Semester, approach the porch with a knife, stab Heffern and flee.  Heffern testified that he did not see who stabbed him and that he did not see anyone other than the appellant and Sweeney on or near the porch at the time of the attack.  He noted, however, that he had blacked out for approximately 10 seconds during the incident.  Semester denied stabbing Heffern.  He testified that he saw three men, including the victim, on or near the porch during the assault, but that he did not see anyone being stabbed.  He also said that there were a number of black men, in addition to himself, who witnessed the event.  James Kelly, Todd Ford and Reginald Nash, who were among the witnesses to the assault on the porch, testified at trial in support of the appellant's version of the events.  It was the Crown's theory that those witnesses, all of whom were friends of the appellant, fabricated their stories in order to place the blame for the stabbing on Semester.  Kelly's evidence was that he saw Semester go up to the porch and stab Heffern.  He also stated that he had spoken to Semester prior to the attack and that Semester appeared to be \"buzzed\" or \"high\" on drugs.  Ford testified that a number of black men were present during the assault and that he saw an individual matching Semester's general description approach the porch, stick his hand through the porch railing, and then flee.  Ford further testified that he noticed moments later that the same man was carrying a knife.  Nash testified that while he did not see anyone run up to the porch or stab Heffern, he did see an individual matching Semester's description, and whom he identified at trial as being Semester, run away from the porch.  He also claimed that there was only one black man among the crowd who witnessed the assault and that he heard a member of the crowd say that Heffern had been stabbed by a black man.  Nash further testified that an hour after the assault had occurred, he met Semester who showed him a bloody knife and admitted to the stabbing.  However, when arrested and charged with aggravated assault in connection with the incident, Nash did not reveal that information to the police.  At trial, he explained his silence on the grounds that he did not want to get anyone involved with the police and that he was afraid that Semester or others would harm him if he implicated Semester in the stabbing.  Another witness, Kerri-Ann Parsons, testified that the only people on or near the porch at the relevant time were the appellant, Sweeney and Heffern.  Parsons also testified that while she saw the appellant hunched over the fallen Heffern, she could not see what he was doing with his arms because his back was to her.  Parsons stated that she did not see anyone stab Heffern.  A number of witnesses stated that the appellant had blood on his right hand after the incident.  The appellant testified that he was holding Heffern, who was in a sitting position, around the head with his left arm while punching him with his right hand when Semester unexpectedly stabbed him in the back.  That evidence was challenged by the Crown during cross-examination on the ground that it would not explain how the appellant got blood on his right hand.  A half hour before the initial scuffle occurred outside Rafferty's, another stabbing occurred a short distance away in the parking lot of a Pizza Pizza restaurant.  The victim, Cameron Day, along with Jim Kelly, the witness who testified on behalf of the appellant, were involved in a fight.  Kelly's evidence was that he and Semester had drawn knives during the altercation, but that he did not see Semester, or anyone else, stab Day.  Day testified that he was involved in a fist fight with a white man when a black man, who he could not identify by photograph, intervened and struck him in the stomach; he later realized that he had been stabbed by the intervener.  Day did not get a good look at the person who stabbed him and gave a description of the assailant that was not entirely consistent with Semester's appearance.  Day also testified that he did not see anyone wield a knife during the incident.  William Cowan, a friend of Day's, testified that he saw a white man and a black man involved in an altercation with Day.  However, he did not get a good look at the black man, nor could he make a photographic identification.  Cowan did not see anyone wield a knife during the altercation.  Semester testified that he and a number of other black men were present during the incident but denied ever carrying a knife or stabbing Day.  Finally, evidence was led to show that Semester had a criminal record for break and enter, theft, breach of probation, and armed robbery during which a gun and a knife were wielded.  With respect to the last conviction, he gave evidence that he merely accompanied the individuals who committed the robbery and that he was unarmed at the time.

        "Facts": " The respondent was charged with two counts of vagrancy under s. 179(1)(b) alleging that on or about July 5, 1989, he did commit vagrancy by loitering at Beacon Hill Park in Victoria.  The first count was framed as loitering \"at or near a playground\".  The second count, which referred to the same events, was framed as loitering \"in or near a public park\".  In 1987 the respondent was convicted of two counts of sexual assault contrary to the former s. 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  These convictions made him subject to the prohibition set out in s. 179(1)(b).  On June 16, 1989, for about two minutes, Police Constable Ronald German observed the respondent standing in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria, British Columbia at the edge of a playground area.  Around his neck the respondent was carrying a camera with a telephoto lens.  The constable did not see the respondent take any pictures or approach or speak to any children.  The respondent then went to another area of the park.  Constable German followed the respondent and called to him.  The respondent stopped, and German identified himself and produced his badge.  He asked the respondent what he was doing in the park.  The respondent replied that he was walking through the park just as he did every day.  After some further discussion, the officer asked the respondent for his address, date of birth, and if he had a criminal record.  The respondent replied that he had a criminal record for sexual assault.  Constable German then told the respondent that his hanging around the park was contrary to the vagrancy section of theCode, and that a convicted sex offender was not permitted to loiter near a public park, school yard or playground.  The respondent asked the officer what he meant by \"loitering\", to which Constable German very astutely replied:  \"loitering meant standing around, apparently doing nothing, standing stationary in a location, or moving slowly in a certain area, stopping at regular intervals and standing around, or else loitering also could mean stopping in a location where it would obstruct persons who use that area too [sic] frequent\".  The officer did not charge the respondent, but warned him not to loiter near the playground at the park again.  On the afternoon of July 5, 1989, Constable Wayne Coleman observed the respondent walking on a pathway leading from the children's playground area in the Beacon Hill Park towards the petting zoo.  After stopping there for a few minutes, the respondent went to his car.  The respondent was once again carrying a camera with a large lens.  Constable Coleman, who was in plain-clothes, followed the respondent in an unmarked police car.  After driving around for approximately half an hour, the respondent returned to the park.  There, the officer saw the respondent seated at a table approximately 50 yards from the playground area.  He then moved to a bench approximately 20 yards from the playground and appeared to be using his camera.  Some five minutes later, the respondent left the park and returned to his car.  Constable Coleman followed the respondent to his residence, where he arrested Heywood and charged him with vagrancy.  The police seized his camera and film.  A search warrant was subsequently executed at his residence.  A picture on the film found in the camera, and a number of pictures found in the respondent's residence and at the drugstore where he had his photographs developed, showed young girls playing in the park, their clothing disarranged from play so that the area of their crotch, although covered by underclothes, was visible.  At his trial, the respondent pleaded not guilty and challenged the constitutionality of s. 179(1)(b) on the grounds that it infringedss. 7,11(d), (h),12and15of theCharter.  The trial judge found that s. 179(1)(b) violatedss. 7and11(d)of theCharter, but that it was a justifiable limit under s. 1.  The respondent was convicted of the first count of vagrancy under s. 179(1)(b).  The second count was conditionally stayed pursuant to the principle expressed inKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  The respondent was sentenced to three months incarceration to be followed by three years probation.  The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which dismissed his appeal.  The Supreme Court judge accepted the trial judge's finding that s. 179(1)(b) violatedss. 7and11(d)of theCharter, but like the trial judge found that they were justified under s. 1.  The respondent appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal, and quashed the conviction.  Hutcheon J.A. (Rowles J.A. concurring) accepted the breaches of ss. 7 and 11(d) as found by the lower courts.  Southin J.A. only found a breach of s. 7.  All three judges of the Court of Appeal found that s. 179(1)(b) was not justified unders. 1of theCharter.  The Crown appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

        "Facts": " The respondent Colette Pétel is charged with the second degree murder of Alain Raymond.  She is the mother of Josée Desjardins, who, at the time of the alleged offence, was Serge Edsell's girlfriend.  Edsell and Raymond were jointly involved in drug trafficking.  Josée Desjardins and Serge Edsell met and began living together in March 1989.  In early May, after being evicted from the apartment where they were living, they moved in temporarily with the respondent.  In her testimony the respondent described the terrible existence caused by Edsell's presence in her house, the fact that he was engaged in drug trafficking there and the comings and goings of his customers in the house.  She said that Edsell was always angry, that he threatened her frequently and that he beat his girlfriend Josée Desjardins.  The respondent even tried to commit suicide.  However, this version of the facts was contradicted by the testimony of Josée Desjardins at the preliminary inquiry.  (Desjardins was killed before the trial and so could not testify at it.)  She denied that she had ever been beaten by Edsell.  In early July the respondent moved in order to put an end to Edsell's presence in her house.  This was unsuccessful, as Edsell continued to go to the respondent's home to conduct his drug trafficking operations.  On July 21, Edsell went to the respondent's home with a revolver, cocaine and scales.  He asked her to hide the weapon.  He forced her to weigh some cocaine and then suggested he would kill her, together with her daughter and granddaughter.  Shortly afterwards Josée Desjardins arrived accompanied by Alain Raymond.  At this point the respondent consumed a small amount of drugs and then went to get the weapon she had hidden in the bathroom.  She fired at Edsell, who fell at once.  Seeing that Raymond was lunging at her, she also fired at him.  Edsell survived but Raymond died of his injuries.  Josée Desjardins' version of the facts was slightly different.  She said that the respondent fired on Edsell and then aimed at her own daughter.  Raymond then tried to escape and that is when the respondent also shot him.  In her statements to the police immediately after these events the respondent admitted firing at Edsell and Raymond and said she wished both of them dead. ",

        "Facts": " Thus it is appropriate to place an evidentiary and legal burden on the accused to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was in a state of extreme intoxication that was akin to automatism or insanity at the time he committed the offence.  Result If the Mental Element Relates Solely to the Actus Reus Which Requires That the Prohibited Act Be Performed Voluntarily  Should it be thought that the mental element involved relates to theactus reusrather than themens reathen the result must be the same.  Theactus reusrequires that the prohibited criminal act be performed voluntarily as a willed act.  A person in a state of automatism cannot perform a voluntary willed act since the automatism has deprived the person of the ability to carry out such an act.  It follows that someone in an extreme state of intoxication akin to automatism must also be deprived of that ability.  Thus a fundamental aspect of theactus reusof the criminal act is absent.  It would equally infringes. 7of theCharterif an accused who was not acting voluntarily could be convicted of a criminal offence.  Here again the voluntary act of becoming intoxicated cannot be substituted for the voluntary action involved in sexual assault.  To do so would violate the principle set out inVaillancourt,supra.  Once again to convict in the face of such a fundamental denial of natural justice could not be justified unders. 1of theCharter.  Summary of Proposed Remedy  In my view, theChartercould be complied with, in crimes requiring only a general intent, if the accused were permitted to establish that, at the time of the offence, he was in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism or insanity.  Just as in a situation where it is sought to establish a state of insanity, the accused must bear the burden of establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that he was in that extreme state of intoxication.  This will undoubtedly require the testimony of an expert.  Obviously, it will be a rare situation where an accused is able to establish such an extreme degree of intoxication.  Yet, permitting such a procedure would mean that a defence would remain open that, due to the extreme degree of intoxication, the minimal mental element required by a general intent offence had not been established.  To permit this rare and limited defence in general intent offences is required so that the common law principles of intoxication can comply with theCharter.  In light of the experience in Australia or New Zealand, it cannot be said that to permit such a defence would open the floodgates to allow every accused who had a drink before committing the prohibited act to raise the defence of drunkenness.  As observed earlier, studies made in Australia and New Zealand indicate that there has not been any significant increase in the number of acquittals following theO'ConnorandKamipelidecisions.

        "Facts": " On December 22, 1989 Durham Regional Police Forces (\"DRPF\") investigated the death of Frank Dowson.  Police described the incident as accidental, but suspicious.  However, after inspecting the scene and interviewing the appellant and another person who resided in the same home as the deceased, the investigation was discontinued and no charges were laid.  On February 6, 1990, at approximately 5:20 p.m., Constable Trimm of the DRPF noted that the appellant had startled two passers-by while he was panhandling on a street in Oshawa.  Trimm stopped his vehicle and questioned the appellant who identified himself as Doug Whittle.  The officer then conducted a computer check through the Canadian Police Information Centre and discovered three outstanding committal warrants against the appellant which related to unpaid fines for provincial offence convictions.  Trimm suspected from the appellant's conduct that he was schizophrenic and the appellant confirmed this when questioned about it.  Trimm cautioned the appellant as to his rights and arrested him on the basis of the outstanding warrants.  The appellant did not exercise his right to consult counsel.  The appellant was then taken by Trimm to a DRPF station where he was placed in a cell.  Constable Trimm told the cell officer that the appellant was mentally unstable and noted \"very mentally unstable\" on the arrest report.  Since the outstanding warrants emanated from the Metro Toronto jurisdiction, the appellant was transported to Metro Police Station, 42 Division at around 6 p.m.  Before being placed in a cell at that location, the appellant again declined to make any phone calls.  Over the course of the next two hours, the appellant made several statements to the station operator and to the staff sergeant at 42 Division.  The first statements indicated that the appellant had been involved in some heavy matters about which he wished to clear the slate.  In later conversations with these officers, the statements became more specific, with the appellant indicating that he had been involved in a number of robberies in Windsor.  At the point when the statements became more specific, two Metro police detectives were asked by the station operator to speak with the appellant.  Detective Constable Orban spoke with the appellant in his cell.  During the course of this conversation, the appellant indicated that he had killed Frank Dowson just before Christmas in 1989 by hitting him on the back of the head with an axe.  In addition, the appellant stated that he had been involved in three robberies in Windsor approximately five years earlier.  Orban testified that he had dealt with the appellant on prior occasions when the appellant had been ejected from donut shops and found sleeping in abandoned cars.  Orban characterized the appellant as a \"loon\", a person whose actions were abnormal, based on the appearance, dress, conduct and manner of speaking of the appellant on prior occasions.  Relying on this impression of the appellant, Orban asked his partner that evening, Detective Constable Gillespie, to speak with the appellant, referring to him as \"the loon\" in the cells.  On speaking with Gillespie, the appellant repeated the same facts which he had relayed to Orban.  Orban and Gillespie then left the cells in order to attempt to verify the occurrences.  At approximately 8:20 p.m. Orban spoke with someone from the DRPF who indicated that a Frank Dowson had died under suspicious circumstances in Whitby just prior to Christmas.  With this confirmation in hand, Orban and Gillespie proceeded to the cells, cautioned the appellant as to his right to counsel and to remain silent, and arrested him for the murder of Frank Dowson.  The appellant indicated that he understood his rights, but that he did not wish to contact a lawyer.  After Gillespie confirmed the Windsor occurrences, at about 9:10 p.m., he arrested the appellant in relation to those robberies.  Again, the appellant was cautioned as to his rights, but he indicated that he did not wish to speak with anyone other than the officers.  Gillespie then questioned the appellant in relation to the axe which he had mentioned in his earlier statement.  The appellant told the officers that he had sawed the axe in half and thrown it in a field near Brock St. and Highway 401.  The appellant then accompanied Orban and Gillespie to the location which he described where they met with two other officers from DRPF.  During the 15-minute car trip to that location, the appellant \"talked continuously\" about the Windsor offences and the occurrence in Whitby.  Although the search was unsuccessful at that point, the axe handle was located during a subsequent search of that area.  On the return trip from the area, the appellant continued to disclose details relating to the murder, including the fact that he had disposed of his shoes after the incident and took precautions to avoid leaving fingerprints at the scene.  Interspersed with this running discussion by the appellant were a series of two or three incidents in which the appellant stopped talking and made reference to someone being in his brain or having fog in his head.  After this, he would continue talking about the incidents in question, as if these digressions had never occurred.  Detective Constable Orban testified that it was more what the appellant said than how he said it which indicated to him that certain of the appellant's statements were divorced from reality.  During the return trip from the 401 location, Gillespie suggested that the appellant make a video statement and the appellant indicated that he liked that idea.  They proceeded to 4 District Headquarters where videotape facilities were available and Gillespie again advised the appellant of his rights under theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Once again, the appellant indicated that he did not wish to speak with a lawyer.  Taping of the first video commenced at 11:40 p.m. on February 6, 1990.  At the outset, the appellant confirmed that he had made statements relating to the commission of serious criminal offences earlier in the evening.  Gillespie then questioned the appellant as to whether he wished to consult counsel and, after some discussion, the appellant indicated that he did wish to consult counsel.  Following on this request, Gillespie contacted a defence attorney, Robert Nuttall, on behalf of the appellant.  Gillespie spoke first with Nuttall and told him that the appellant had confessed to several serious crimes.  Nuttall agreed to speak with the appellant and testified that he had advised the appellant to \"keep his mouth shut\".  He also testified that the appellant had told him that he had voices in his head, that he had to talk, that he had a pain in his head and that he could see dead babies' faces in cement.  The appellant told Nuttall that he needed to talk to the police in order to stop the voices.  After speaking with the appellant, Nuttall was convinced that the appellant would speak with authorities against his advice.  When the appellant turned the phone over to Gillespie, Nuttall indicated that he agreed with Gillespie's characterization of the appellant as a \"loon\" or a \"nutbar\" and that he was sure that the appellant would speak with the authorities, in spite of Nuttall's advice to the contrary.  Nuttall also told Gillespie that any other officers who wished to speak with the appellant should contact Nuttall before doing so.  As predicted by Nuttall, the appellant indicated that he still wished to continue with the video statement.  In the result, a second video statement was initiated at 12:21 a.m. on February 7, 1990.  This statement lasted approximately one hour.  At the outset, the appellant stated that he had not committed the offences described in the committal warrants and alleged \"somebody has used my name\".  He described his reason for coming to the police as the result of \"crackin' in [his] mind\" and his resulting inability to live in society any longer.  When reminded of the exercise of his right to counsel, the appellant acknowledged that he was informed that he had the right not to speak with the police, but that he wanted to talk to them anyway.  Further, he indicated that he understood that it would be up to a judge whether or not his statements would be used in making a decision about him.  After some prompting by Gillespie, the appellant repeated the details relating to the death of Frank Dowson which he had relayed earlier.  Throughout the video statement the appellant made comments such as \"I'm just ah, feel like I got snow in my head\", \"I feel like I got [other people's] brains on me . . . So they're always tryin' a' think out a' me ... And every time I say somethin', unless I been asked a question, I can't think above them . . . we're both bein' punished\", and \"I managed to, ah, come up with this idea to walk backwards to New Brunswick . . . That would exercise me back to normal\".  When asked whether he had been forced to say anything, the appellant indicated that he was uncertain whether he had been manipulated into it in that \"somebody maybe plotted murder in this life and they picked me to do it for them, right?\".  The appellant also stated that he had always wanted to die, but that he had never been able to and that he intended to stay on his tippy-toes regardless of whether anyone liked it.  After the video statement was taken the appellant volunteered to take Detective Constables Orban and Gillespie to the place where he claimed to have disposed of the wallet of Frank Dowson.  Although the wallet was not located on the trip to the ravine that night, it was located by Orban and Gillespie in that area some time over the next two days.  When found the wallet contained $800 in cash and at least one credit card bearing the name Frank Dowson.  Orban and Gillespie transported the appellant back to 42 Division, Metro Toronto Police Force.  At about 4:10 p.m., Detective Constables Carroll and Chambers of the DRPF spoke with the appellant in an interview room at 42 Division.  The appellant was arrested for the first degree murder of Frank Dowson and cautioned as to hisCharterrights, which the appellant indicated that he understood.  The appellant did not exercise his right to counsel.  Although there had been some indication by members of the Metro Toronto Police Force that Chambers and Carroll should contact the appellant's lawyer, they proceeded to transport the appellant back to 17 Division DRPF in Oshawa without doing so.  During the drive back to 17 Division, the appellant responded to questioning by Chambers, providing the details of the death of Frank Dowson, including what Dowson was wearing, the amount of cash in his wallet and the fact that the appellant had hit him in the head with the blunt side of an axe.  The appellant also indicated that after he hit Dowson, he went to a friend's house to purchase drugs.  The appellant's lawyer, Robert Nuttall, testified that he saw the appellant on or about February 8 and 16, 1990.  At this point, the behaviour of the appellant was judged by Nuttall to be quite bizarre.  As a result, Nuttall consented to the appellant being remanded to the Metropolitan Toronto Forensic Service (\"METFORS\") facility for psychiatric examination in order to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.  The next contact which Chambers and Carroll had with the appellant was on March 16, 1990 when the appellant was being returned from a 30-day psychiatric assessment.  Chambers and Carroll met the appellant on the back stairs of the court house and followed him to the cell block there.  The appellant indicated that he wanted to speak to them even though his lawyer had advised him not to.  The appellant then stated that there had been no blood around Dowson's mouth after he had hit him, but that when he returned to the scene, Dowson was laying on the floor with blood around his mouth.  He also indicated the name and address of the person from whom he claimed to have purchased drugs after the incident in question.  Prior to trial, the appellant underwent psychiatric examination the results of which supported his fitness to stand trial.  Apparently for this reason no issue was raised by either the prosecution, the defence or the court as to the appellant's fitness to stand trial.  At the commencement of the trial, Crown counsel proposed to introduce into evidence all of the statements made by the appellant to various police officers.  In order to deal with the admissibility of this evidence avoir direwas held, during which a number of expert witnesses were called.  Perhaps the most central testimony came from Dr. Malcolm, who testified for the defence, and Dr. McDonald, who testified for the Crown.  Dr. McDonald is a forensic psychiatrist with METFORS who examined the appellant during his 30-day psychiatric assessment in February and March 1990.  Dr. Malcolm is also a forensic psychiatrist.  Both gave the opinion that the appellant suffers from schizophrenia and that a common symptom of this illness is auditory hallucination.  However, Dr. Malcolm testified that the appellant's condition would have been florid at the time of the video statement and that although the appellant may have been rationally aware of the consequences of giving the statement, he was driven to make the statements by the voices in his head.  In contrast, Dr. McDonald testified that it was possible that the appellant had been experiencing auditory hallucinations at the time of the video statement, but that there was no specific evidence of that in the tape itself.  Ruling on thevoir dire, the trial judge concluded that the exculpatory statement made by the appellant on December 22, 1989 was admissible, but that the inculpatory statements made on February 6, 7 and March 16, 1990 were inadmissible.  Crown counsel then advised that no further evidence would be called on behalf of the Crown.  The trial judge then instructed the jury to deliver a verdict of acquittal and a \"not guilty\" verdict was returned.  The respondent Crown successfully appealed the acquittal of the appellant.  The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial which would include all of the statements made by the appellant.

        "Facts": " On April 20, 1989, the respondent was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  The car which the respondent was driving contained several passengers.  One of the passengers died following the accident and another two were injured, one of them seriously.  The respondent was charged with one count of impaired driving causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm.  The respondent's trial was held before Aylward J. of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, and a jury.  The evidence revealed that Constable Stanley, who arrived first at the scene of the accident cautioned the respondent, advised him of his rights unders. 10of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsand made a breathalyzer demand.  Stanley had determined from other persons at the scene that the respondent was the person driving the vehicle and noted that he smelled of alcohol and was staggering.  Stanley then took the respondent to the police station and delivered him into the control of Constable Tilley, who asked him if he understood his right to contact counsel and assisted the respondent in doing so.  In fact, a telephone book was supplied and Tilley called several lawyers before finding one of them available.  When the respondent's counsel was contacted, Tilley informed him that the officers had received word that one of the passengers had died.  Tilley then turned the phone over to the respondent so that he could have a private discussion with his counsel.  Prior to the respondent's conversation with his lawyer, he heard the officers say that one of the passengers had died and was told that two others were in serious condition.  After consulting with legal counsel, the respondent refused to provide the police with a sample of his breath.  However, once informed that a charge for failing to comply with a demand for a breath sample would be laid if he refused, the respondent complied.  His counsel telephoned the station after the first sample was given and spoke with the respondent again.  After this, a second sample was taken.  Both samples contained 170 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  The respondent indicated that he was aware that one friend had died and two others were seriously injured, that the demand for a breath sample indicated that if he failed he would be charged with impaired driving and that if he refused to provide the breath sample he could be charged with refusing to do so.  At trial, the respondent's counsel objected to the admission of the breath samples results on the ground that the police had acted in violation ofss. 10(a)and (b) of theCharter.  Avoir direon the admissibility of the breath samples and statements made by the respondent at the police station was held and Aylward J. concluded that the evidence ought to be excluded unders. 24(2)of theCharterbecause the respondent had been denied his rights unders. 10of theCharter.  Crown counsel requested a recess and, after 30 minutes, returned to tell the court that it did not plan to call further evidence.  Given that, prior to thevoir dire, the Crown had called only one witness, a police officer who took photographs of the aftermath of the accident, the trial judge charged the jury to deliver a verdict of acquittal.  On January 29, 1991, the respondent was acquitted.  The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland on the ground that the analysis of the breath samples should have been admitted into evidence.  On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from acquittal.  The majority of the Court concluded that the trial judge had erred in excluding evidence which was unarguably important, but that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the appeal had been unnecessary given that the Crown could have called further substantial evidence at trial, but chose not to.  Goodridge C.J., dissenting, held that the provisions ofs. 686(4)of theCriminal Codewere mandatory and that s. 686(4) required the court to order a new trial if it determined that the appeal should be allowed.

(M.B.), supra, at p. 577, \"[p]erhaps the single most important organizing principle in criminal law is the right of an accused not to be forced into assisting in his or her own prosecution\" -- the \"case to meet\" principle. This principle, I noted, \"is perhaps best described in terms of the overarching principle against self-incrimination, which is firmly rooted in the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \" (p. 577). The use immunity provided by s. 13  of the Charter , together with the s. 7 based derivative-use immunity proposed by my colleague Iacobucci J., will protect witnesses against the possibility of their testimony being used directly as evidence against them, or being used indirectly as a means of gathering derivative incriminatory evidence. In many cases, these forms of immunity will provide adequate protection for the principle against self-incrimination. In some situations, however, forcing a witness to testify will violate the case-to-meet principle in a manner that cannot be remedied by an exclusionary rule. For example, the compelled testimony might reveal an accused's defence strategy, or bring to light crimes of which the state was previously unaware. In these latter cases, attempting to protect the principle against self-incrimination through use immunity and derivative-use immunity would indeed be, as my colleague Sopinka J. notes (at p. 625), \"like closing the barn door after",

Charges against the two were separately laid because of an administrative procedure applicable at that court which directs that younger accused be tried in Phase One youth court, and the older accused in Phase Two. J.P.M. was to be the Crown's main witness at the trial of R.J.S. However, after R.J.S. was arraigned but before he entered a plea, counsel for J.P.M. brought a motion to quash the subpoena which had been issued to compel J.P.M.'s testimony. The trial judge allowed the motion and quashed the subpoena. The Crown proceeded with the trial against R.J.S. and called two witnesses: Isaac Chung, the owner of the business where the offence allegedly occurred, and Detective Constable Carter. Chung testified about the property which disappeared from his store and which the police later returned to him. Carter testified that R.J.S., whom he knew to be wanted in relation to an offence, arrived at the police station one day and turned over certain property to him. Carter said that he tagged the items he received from R.J.S. and placed them in the control of a property officer who did not testify at trial. The defence called no evidence.

The Crown appealed, and the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the subpoena issued against J.P.M. should not have been quashed: (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 774, 61 O.A.C. 395, 80 C.C.C. (3d) 397, 21 C.R.

R.J.S. appeals as of right to this Court pursuant tos. 27(1)of theYoung Offenders Actands. 691(2)(a) of theCriminal Codeon a question of law alone. On this point, the Court inR. v. C.

            "II.                The respondent Crown made an application under s. 486  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 39  of the Young Offenders Act  and the common law for either an order of non-publication of any of the evidence or an order of non-publication of evidence relating to the allegations of the children.  The appellant, the respondent Armadale Communications and media representatives, sought leave to make representations in relation to the application.  The trial of T.S. was the first of a series of related trials, involving the same complainants, but her trial was the only one where a request for a restriction on publication of evidence was made.",
            "VIII.            Bayda C.J.S. continued by observing that if the appeal before him were treated simply as an ordinary appeal in a criminal proceeding, then, following s. 674  of the Criminal Code , the CBC would have no right of appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.  Appeals are solely creatures of statute, Bayda C.J.S. remarked, and there is no inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court.  Moreover, he declared, jurisdiction in this case could not be found in s. 6 of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-42: R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764.  Similarly, jurisdiction could not be grounded in the inherent power vested in the Court of Appeal by s. 24(1)  of the Charter  and s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, if the appeal in the case at bar were seen as an appeal from an interlocutory ruling by the trial court judge in the course of a criminal proceeding, then the fact that it involved an alleged Charter  breach did not vest the Court of Appeal with any special power to hear an appeal.  Rather, the right of appeal was governed by the same principles that applied to an appeal from an ordinary interlocutory ruling (and there is no appeal from an interlocutory ruling made in a criminal proceeding).",
            "XIII.            The Crown brought the motion to the correct judge (the judge in charge of the trial of T.S.).  The CBC tried to appeal the trial judge's decision to the Court of Appeal.  The CBC should have made an application for certiorari to a superior court judge because the trial judge was a judge in the provincial youth court and that is not a provincial superior court.  If the application had been denied, then the CBC could have appealed the superior court judge's decision to the Court of Appeal (under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code ).",
            "XIV.            The Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear from the CBC.  While this Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Court of Appeal decision, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the order itself.  The CBC should have made an application for certiorari to the superior court.  From there, an appeal was available to the Court of Appeal under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  From there, an appeal was available to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .  Unlike in the companion case of Dagenais, it is not open to this Court to grant leave to appeal the order itself proprio motu, nunc pro tunc, ex post facto.  There is no direct appeal avenue to the Supreme Court from an order banning publication made by a provincial court judge.",
            "XVI.            First, as I wrote in the companion case of Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, there is no third party right of appeal from an interlocutory criminal order.  This is true whether the order is issued by a superior court judge or a provincial court judge.  In this respect, I agree fully with the reasons of Bayda C.J.S. and find that the appellant had no right of appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and no right of appeal to this Court.",
            "XVII.          Nonetheless, while a third party cannot challenge an interlocutory criminal order by way of appeal, I agree with Lamer C.J. that a third party can challenge an interlocutory criminal order by way of certiorari where the interlocutory order in question was issued by a provincial court judge.  In the case at hand, however, the appellant made no such challenge.  Accordingly, it is not strictly necessary to discuss the scope of review under certiorari or the remedial power available to the reviewing judge under this extraordinary remedy.  Nonetheless, I wish to emphasize that where the order being reviewed is, as here, the product of a provincial court judge's legally authorized discretion, a challenge by way of certiorari should only rarely succeed.  Certiorari is an extraordinary remedy and cannot be used to substitute one judge's discretion for that of another.  Furthermore, a discretionary order per se cannot be challenged on Charter  grounds as the Charter  does not, as I noted in Dagenais, apply to court orders per se.",
            "XVIII.         While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  does not apply to court orders per se, it does apply to common law rules authorizing such court orders.  However, this said, I concluded in Dagenais that the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans in criminal proceedings is consistent with the Charter .  Consequently, any challenge to this aspect of the common law must fail."

In applying this test the findings of the jury in the case under appeal may be a factor in determining what the hypothetical reasonable jury would have done, provided those findings are not tainted by the error. In cases in which an included offence is not left with the jury, a conviction by the jury of the more serious offence cannot generally be relied on by reason of the fact that it may very well be a reaction against a complete acquittal. There is an apprehension that the jury convicted because they had no other alternative than acquittal and acquittal was unpalatable. In this case, the jury had an alternative: they could have convicted of manslaughter. It cannot be said that it did not do so by reason of the failure to charge them by reference to the objective standard of liability with respect to manslaughter. In convicting of murder the jury must have found that the appellant had subjective foresight of death. It is impossible to hold that they came to this conclusion because they were unable to conclude that the appellant had subjective foresight of bodily harm."

            "Two issues were raised on appeal.  First, it was suggested that the jury's verdict should be set aside because the jury may have drawn an improper inference from the accused's failure to testify, as evidenced by the return of a verdict shortly after putting a question concerning the accused's right not to testify.  The second and principal ground of appeal is that the jury's verdict of guilty was unreasonable and should be set aside under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code .",

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged that, between January 1, 1979, and January 3, 1983, he sexually assaulted the complainant.  The complainant did not report the assaults until 1990.  The appellant's trial from March 30 to April 2, 1992 was held before Morin J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, and a jury.   The only evidence at the trial was the complainant's, who testified at trial that at the time of the alleged assaults she lived with her family next door to the appellant.  Her family did not have a telephone. They had the appellant's permission to use his.  She testified that, in approximately 1981, when she was 13 years old, she was sent to make a telephone call at the appellant's home, and while she was there he raped her.  She said that she froze, was frightened, and said nothing to her parents.  During the year that her family lived next door to the appellant, the complainant initially testified that she was regularly sent to the appellant's home to make telephone calls, and that he raped her on 10 to 20 such occasions.  The complainant testified during examination in chief that she did not report the assaults until 1990 because she was afraid of what the appellant might do to her. During the complainant's cross-examination, it was disclosed that in her initial statement to the police in January of 1990, she stated that the appellant had raped her three times.  At the preliminary hearing, she stated that he raped her five or six times.  At the trial, in 1992 she said he had raped her 10 to 20 times.  The complainant explained this by saying that it was \"hard to put a number [on] exactly how many times these things happen to you\".  The complainant was cross-examined with respect to an affidavit sworn by her in 1989 and filed in wardship proceedings concerning her son, in which she swore that she had never been sexually abused.  She was also cross-examined with respect to testimony she gave in 1987, in proceedings claiming support from her son's father, in which she swore that she was a virgin prior to 1985.  Once confronted with these, the affidavit and the sworn statement in cross-examination, the complainant stated that she believed the statements were true at the time she made them, because she had blocked out the incidents involving the appellant until her memory returned in a flashback in 1990.   This evidence in cross-examination was in direct contradiction to her testimony in chief that she did not complain until 1990 because of her fear of the appellant.  The complainant testified that this flashback in 1990 occurred during a period when she was being interviewed by police and children's aid workers in connection with further wardship proceedings over her son and following suggestions allegedly by the police that if she thought about what the police told her she might have a flashback and in her mind remember. This suggestion occurred at a time when the complainant was seeking custody of her son and felt she needed the co-operation of the police who she had admitted saying were hounding her.  The appellant did not testify in his defence. The jury after deliberating for two hours returned to ask for clarification as to the appellant's right to take the stand in his own defence.  The trial judge answered, saying that the appellant was entitled to give evidence or call evidence on his behalf, but that there was no onus on him to prove his innocence.  The jury returned 10 minutes later with a verdict of guilty.  The appellant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the principal ground of appeal being that the verdict was unreasonable.  The appellant claimed that the jury, which returned with a verdict immediately after being instructed on the appellant's right to take the stand in his defence, drew an improper inference from the failure of the appellant to give evidence.  On June 24, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal, Carthy J.A. dissented:  (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 191, 64 O.A.C. 140, 82 C.C.C.  (3d) 441, 21 C.R. (4th) 350. ",

        "Facts": " 2The appellant, Crawford, and his co-accused, Creighton, were charged with second degree murder of Behnke.  One night in early November 1988, Crawford and Creighton, who are distant cousins, went out drinking at a Belleville bar where they met and befriended the deceased, who was impaired.  The three men left the bar together, all appearing to witnesses to be drunk, and the deceased was robbed and beaten with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber.  The autopsy of the victim revealed that the immediate cause of death was a \"massive area of bruising\" within the victim's brain, consistent with the application of \"massive blunt force\" to the top of his head, but the pathologist did not rule out interplay between head injuries and serious injuries to other parts of his body.  The cause of death thus was stated to be multiple trauma to the head and body.  3The Crown's theory was that Crawford and Creighton pretended to befriend the impaired deceased, invited him to a party with the intention of robbing him, and after robbing him, either Crawford or Creighton or both beat the deceased viciously with a 2 x 4 causing his death.  4Crawford made no statement to the police.  He testified at trial, 13 months after the murder, that he had never struck the deceased and denied that he had aided or abetted in the assault.  Crawford testified that, on leaving the bar with Creighton and the deceased, the deceased had grabbed the waitress's leg and apologized and Creighton had told the waitress that he would \"take care of it\".  On the way to the party, Creighton hit the deceased without warning and the two exchanged about four punches before Crawford could intervene.  He tried to grab the deceased but lost his balance and he and the deceased fell to the ground with the deceased on top.  They began to scuffle when Creighton hit the deceased on the back with a 2 x 4.  Crawford became scared, shoved the deceased off him, and ran away.  When Creighton caught up to him, Creighton said \"I think I killed him\".  5Creighton's counsel cross-examined Crawford on Crawford's failure to make any statements to the police:    Q.Mr. Crawford, if my memory is correct the incident that brings us here today happened one year and 20 days ago; is that right?  A.I think so, yes.  I'm not too sure, I didn't check.  Q.Well, it's the 22nd day of November today, 1989?  A.Yes.  Q.Do you agree with that?  A.Yes.  Q.So this incident happened one year and 20 days ago?  A.Yes.  Q.You have had one year and 20 days to think about what you were going to tell us about this?  A.Just the truth.  Q.You've had one year and 20 days to think about it.  A.Just the truth.  Q.Have you ever told the police anything about it?  A.No.  Q.Have you ever told anybody in authority anything about it?  A.Just my lawyer.  Q.You have been well represented by counsel?  A.Yes.  Q.You were aware through your counsel what all the evidence was in this case?  A.Well, yes.  6Creighton did not testify at trial.  His version of the events was set out in a videotaped statement to the police on his arrest.  Creighton said that he, Crawford, and the victim had left the pub on the way to a party.  Crawford and the victim were arguing as they walked.  When a fight broke out between Crawford and the deceased, Creighton intervened and tried to break it up.  When that failed, since the deceased was on top of Crawford, he hit the deceased across the back about four times with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber (about 3 feet long).  Crawford continued to beat the victim with his fists, despite Creighton grabbing Crawford and telling him to stop since the victim was already hurt.  Unable to break up the fight, he climbed over a fence and left the scene.  At the point that he left, Creighton told the police that the deceased was still alive.  Crawford soon came running behind him saying that they had to \"get . . . out of here I think I killed him\".  7Effectively, each accused cast the blame primarily, if not entirely, upon the other, and each relied upon the defence of intoxication as negativing the intent for murder.  At trial, Creighton's counsel made much of the fact that Crawford had declined to give a statement to the police on his arrest, contrasting unfavourably with Creighton's full statement to the police at the earliest opportunity.   Conversely, Crawford's counsel, when addressing the jury, stated that \"an innocent man sitting in Creighton's seat would have gotten into that witness box and sworn that he was not guilty\".  Crawford's counsel also dealt with Creighton's counsel's cross-examination of Crawford in his closing address to the jury.  8On November 28, 1989, the appellant and co-accused were both convicted of second degree murder by White J. of the Ontario Supreme Court sitting with a jury.  They appealed their convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  Crawford claimed that: (1)the trial judge erred in allowing counsel for the co-accused to cross-examine him on his failure to give a statement to the police, thus infringing his right to remain silent; and  (2)the trial judge had erred in not instructing the jury to disregard that cross-examination on his pre-trial silence.  On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals:  (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 130, 62 O.A.C. 91, 80 C.C.C. (3d) 421, 20 C.R. (4th) 331, 14 C.R.R. (2d) 93.  Weiler J.A. dissented, holding that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the use that it could make of the evidence that Crawford had not given a statement to police, in light of his constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent, and would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

        "Facts": " 1The appellant was convicted of two counts of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of choking with intent to commit an indictable offence.  He was acquitted at trial of two other charges.  The four charges arose out of two separate incidents relating to attacks on a female complainant (C.L.F.) in September  1986, and on a second female complainant (M.S.F.) in October 1986.  Both victims were attacked immediately after leaving the underground parking area of their respective apartment buildings.  Both women were beaten and choked and suffered bodily harm.  2On September 25, 1986, C.L.F. returned to her apartment building at about 1 a.m.  She parked her car in the underground garage and went to the elevator.  While waiting, she heard footsteps from behind but did not turn around.  At that moment, she was attacked from behind as a black object came in front of her face and was then pulled tightly around her neck.  After seeing her attacker briefly, C.L.F. passed out as a result of the choking.  When she awoke, she noticed that her purse was gone.  3On October 28, 1986, M.S.F. returned to her apartment building between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.  After parking her car in the underground garage she ran to the stairway leading to the foyer.  She was confronted by a man who pushed her against a wall, punched her and then beat her and stomped on her.  M.S.F. yelled \"fire\" and her assailant got up, looked at her and walked out the door.  M.S.F. then went for assistance and was taken to the hospital.  4At trial, the appellant testified that, on the night of October 28, 1986, he was at a show from around 7:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.  He claimed that, after leaving the show early, he then walked his dog and went to visit a friend who was not home.  The appellant stated that he then drove to two bars and left his car at a parking garage around 11:25 p.m.  Upon returning to his car, the appellant was arrested.  This was approximately 2 1/2 hours after the attack of M.S.F.  5In order to refute the alibi of the appellant, the Crown called the evidence of Ms. Ruth Geurts in rebuttal.  She testified that, at around 8:30 p.m. that evening, she had been followed by the appellant in his car, while driving to the garage of her apartment building.  At the time this evidence was adduced, the Crown did not specify its purpose and no objection was taken to its admissibility.  The appellant was permitted to call surrebuttal evidence in response.  6The appellant was tried by an all-female jury and was convicted on the four counts relating to the attacks on C.L.F. and M.S.F.  Crown counsel had set out to empanel an all-female jury and succeeded in doing so by virtue of the formers. 634of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(which has since been declared unconstitutional inR. v. Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91).  That provision gave the Crown four peremptory challenges and 48 stand-bys while the appellant had only 12 peremptory challenges and no stand-bys.  7Identity was the only issue in dispute at trial.  The appellant appealed the verdict based on three grounds.  First, he argued that the convictions were unreasonable due to the frailty of the identification evidence.  Secondly, he argued that the reply evidence of Ms. Geurts was not properly admissible, claiming that the Crown split its case.  Finally, it was argued that, by empanelling an all-female jury, the Crown abused its use of the stand-by power which was still in effect at the time of the trial.  8The appeal was dismissed by a unanimous Court of Appeal for Ontario ((1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 756).  Although it was recognized that the identification evidence was admittedly less than ideal, Doherty J.A. concluded that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have returned a guilty verdict on the four charges.  The Court of Appeal also rejected the contention that the Crown's use of stand-bys to empanel an all-female jury would create a reasonable apprehension of bias.  The final ground of appeal relating to the admissibility of the reply evidence also failed.  Doherty J.A. held that the evidence of Ms. Geurts became much more relevant after the appellant had testified concerning his location at 8:30 p.m.  As well, there was no prejudice to the appellant since he was aware of the nature of the evidence of Ms. Geurts and had an opportunity to respond to it.  Thus, it was held that the trial judge did not err in admitting the reply evidence.

            "Consider the situation in which a person must decide whether or not to speak to the police.  Once the decision to speak is made in the criminal law context (absent concerns about voluntariness or exclusion for Charter  breaches), the evidence is available for all purposes. The law recognizes some protected situations, such as where compelled testimony cannot be used against the witness in other proceedings.  But generally speaking, once the decision to speak is made, the evidence so obtained is admissible if relevant.  I am far from convinced that the same general principle should not operate with respect to consent to provide blood samples in the criminal law context.  We do not give effect to the individual's desire to speak on condition that what is said is helpful to his or her case.  Likewise, I do not think we should open the door to conditional or limited consents in the criminal law context.",
            "The context and circumstances are markedly different in the case of consent given to police to take blood as part of the investigation of a serious criminal charge than where consent is given for the purpose of medical treatment.  There is a  high level of expectation of privacy and confidentiality associated with medical treatment and an important benefit in its being provided. Moreover, where the blood sample has been properly obtained for a medical purpose, the police will usually have the option of seeking prior judicial authorization to seize the sample. The consent relates to taking the sample from the body.  Once the sample is in existence, the results of its analysis may be obtained upon suitable prior judicial authorization.  The context is quite different in a case such as the present one.  The consent is elicited in the criminal law context and for law enforcement purposes.  There is no confusion between medical treatment and criminal investigation.  There will often be no alternative investigative technique available in absence of consent.  Without the blood sample in this case, as Constable Roberts conceded in cross-examination, there was no other evidence. This is not to say that any and all techniques are permitted to get evidence when it is otherwise hard to come by.  It is to point out that balancing the reasonable expectation of privacy and the needs of law enforcement must take account of the context and circumstances in the particular situation."

        "Facts": " 72Therefore, because in that case there was evidence that Pierman might have consumed alcohol just prior to being stopped by the police, it was legitimate to delay the test.  Whereas, in Dewald's case, the police had no information as to when the accused last consumed alcohol and so delaying the test was not justifiable.  Arbour J.A. held that the police can only detain a suspect for an extra 15 minutes where there is some factual basis upon which to suspect that the screening device would yield an inaccurate result.  73I adopt the flexible approach taken by Arbour J.A.  In my view, it is in accord with the purpose of the statutory scheme and ensures that a police officer has an honest belief based on reasonable and probable grounds prior to making a breathalyzer demand.  Waiting 15 minutes is permitted under s. 254(2) of theCodewhen this is in accordance with the exigencies of the use of the equipment.  This applies when an officer is aware of the potential inaccuracy in the particular case.  74Although there is no doubt that the screening test should generally be administered as quickly as possible, it would entirely defeat the purpose of Parliament to require the police to administer the screening test immediately in circumstances where the results would be rendered totally unreliable and flawed.  The flexible approach strikes the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving, on the one hand, and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.  I do not believe that the matter is advanced by quoting statistics.  Although we all agree that Parliament has every reason to vigorously pursue the objective of reducing the carnage on our highways, that objective is not advanced by subjecting innocent persons to invasions of privacy on the basis of faulty tests.  I do not believe that this is what Parliament intended in enactings. 254of theCriminal Code.  75I note that a potential problem which may arise from delaying the screening test, and which was discussed by my colleague in his reasons as well as by Arbour J.A., is whether the suspect is entitled to access to counsel when detained for a longer period.  In theThomsencase, it was held that the roadside screening procedure was a reasonable limit on one's right to counsel unders. 10(b)of theCharter.  In my view, a delay in the order of 15 minutes in order to obtain a proper sample of breath is not inconsistent withThomsen.  It would indeed be strange for us to hold that the rights of some persons under one provision of theCharter(s. 8) must be sacrificed in order to preserve the limit on their rights under another provision (s. 10(b)).  C.Application to the facts of this case  76In light of the above analysis, it is necessary to determine whether, on the facts of this particular case, the police officer had an honest belief on reasonable and probable grounds that the respondent had committed an offence under s. 253 of theCodenotwithstanding the potential unreliability of the screening device.  77As my colleague Cory J. noted, several other potential indicia of impairment were present in this case aside from the evidence provided by the screening test.  Constable Mashford testified that he noticed a vehicle exceeding the speed limit and drifting, on two occasions, from the shoulder of the road to the centre and back with the brake lights flickering on and off.  As well, upon questioning the respondent, a smell of liquor was detected and the respondent admitted that he had been drinking.  Furthermore, Constable Mashford also noticed that the respondent's eyes were extremely red and glassy.  Based on the foregoing, arguably the police officer could have had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breathalyzer even absent any screening device test results.  In that case, the potential unreliability of the test results would not vitiate any belief based on reasonable and probable grounds.  78However, Constable Mashford testified as follows: ",

        "Facts": " If in the present case the jury were satisfied that the car was driven towards the garage in pursuance of a murderous plan and that the appellant knew that that was the plan and intentionally drove the car in execution of that plan, he could be held to have aided and abetted even though he regretted the plan or indeed was horrified by it.  However great his reluctance, he would have intended to aid and abet.  36The position at common law, of course, does not in and of itself determine the meaning to be ascribed to the word \"purpose\" in the context of s. 21(1)(b) of theCode.  It can, however, provide useful guidance when it comes to choosing between the two interpretations of the term that are available -- one that accords with the common law position and the other that contradicts it.  In the absence of reason to believe that Parliament intended its enactment of s. 21(1)(b) to radically alter the common law principles governing party liability, the interpretation that accords with the common law would seem to also be the most likely to accurately embody Parliament's intentions.  This observation strengthens my conclusion that Parliament's use of the term \"purpose\" in s. 21(1)(b) should not be seen as incorporating the notion of \"desire\" into the mental state for party liability, and that the word should instead be understood as being essentially synonymous with \"intention\".  37This interpretation is, moreover, consistent with the approach that has been taken on previous occasions by this Court in connection with s. 21(1)(b).  InR. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, for instance, Cory J. (writing for a majority of the Court) stated (at p. 88):  [T]he person aiding or abetting the crime [of murder] must intend that death ensue or intend that he or the perpetrator cause bodily harm of a kind likely to result in death and be reckless whether death ensues or not.  It is implicit in this statement that there is no requirement under s. 21(1)(b) that the person charged as a party \"desire\" that the victim die (that is, subjectively wish that this result come to pass), just as the principal’s intent to kill is not negated even if, all other things being equal, he or she regrets the fact that he or she is killing the victim.  Similarly, inR. v. Jackson, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 573, the Court commented on the mental element for conviction of murder as a party under s. 21(1).  Writing for the Court, McLachlin J. stated (at p. 581):  In this case, Jackson [the principal] committed the offence of murder.  It was open on the evidence for the jury to find that Davy aided and abetted him in that offence, and is guilty unders. 21(1)(b) and (c) of theCriminal Code.If he possessed the necessarymens reafor murder he could be guilty of murder.

            "1                 Sopinka J. — This appeal concerns the limits of Crown disclosure obligations in criminal prosecutions, flowing from this Court's decision in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, and amplifies the procedural structure of disclosure obligations as articulated in R. v. Stinchcombe, and subsequent case law. Specifically, the issue is whether an accused facing trial on a criminal charge is entitled to know if he or she has been named as a primary or secondary target in any wiretap authorizations unrelated to the investigation of the current criminal charge, obtained in the period from the charge up to the time of trial.",
            "3                 Since the appellants elected trial by judge and jury, on March 20, 1992, a pre-hearing conference pursuant to s. 625.1(2)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (ad. R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 127), took place. Given the complex evidentiary and constitutional issues raised by the appellants, McDonald J. directed that April 15, 1992 to May 1, 1992 be set aside for the trial judge to deal with all motions and evidentiary matters that could be determined in the absence of the jury.",
            "4                 Before the hearing commenced, the appellants made a written request to the provincial prosecutor and to the Edmonton office of the Department of Justice, requesting that provincial and federal authorities disclose whether either of the appellants were named as primary or secondary targets in any undisclosed Criminal Code , Part VI electronic interceptions during the period 1988 to April 15, 1992.",
            ". . . the overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the ability of the accused to make full answer and defence. This common law right has acquired new vigour by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as one of the principles of fundamental justice. . . . The right to make full answer and defence is one of the pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure that the innocent are not convicted.",
            "27               In wiretap cases, the existence of wiretaps (unlike the case at bar) is usually not in issue. In Dersch, supra, for example, the accuseds had been given notice that the Crown intended to adduce evidence obtained as a result of Criminal Code  wiretap authorizations made as part of the investigations into the charges being tried. The accuseds applied for an order for access to the contents of the sealed packets containing the affidavits in support of the authorizations, claiming that they were needed for them to make full answer and defence. In restoring the order of the trial judge to grant the application, this Court noted that the accuseds could not gain access to the affidavit unless they could prove the grounds for such access, and could not prove such grounds unless they had access. The significant and distinguishing feature of that case, however, from this appeal is that the existence of the wiretap in relation to the charges being tried was never in doubt.",
            "32               Apart from its practical necessity in advancing the debate to which I refer above, the requirement that the defence provide a basis for its demand for further production serves to preclude speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming disclosure requests. In cases involving wiretaps, such as this appeal, this is particularly important. Fishing expeditions and conjecture must be separated from legitimate requests for disclosure. Routine disclosure of the existence of wiretaps in relation to a particular accused who has been charged, but who is the subject of wiretaps for ongoing criminal investigations in relation to other suspected offences, would impede the ability of the state to investigate a broad array of sophisticated crimes which are otherwise difficult to detect, such as drug-trafficking, extortion, fraud and insider trading: R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 44. Wiretaps are generally only effective if their existence is unknown to the persons under investigation. This is implicitly recognized in the secrecy provisions of Part VI of the Code, s. 187 and s. 193 which govern until the investigation expires, and the deferred notification of the existence of a wiretap by s. 196."
        ],
        "Facts": " 2Pursuant to an indictment, dated July 9, 1991, the appellant, David Allan Chaplin, was charged with 22 counts, and the appellant, Dale Leonard Chaplin, was charged with four counts of break and enter and theft, allegedly committed between 1984 and 1989. The appellants were arrested on these charges in December, 1989, and were free on bail through to the commencement of their trial. The preliminary inquiry into these charges resulted in an order for the appellants to stand trial.  3Since the appellants elected trial by judge and jury, on March 20, 1992, a pre-hearing conference pursuant tos. 625.1(2)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(ad. R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 127), took place. Given the complex evidentiary and constitutional issues raised by the appellants, McDonald J. directed that April 15, 1992 to May 1, 1992 be set aside for the trial judge to deal with all motions and evidentiary matters that could be determined in the absence of the jury.  4Before the hearing commenced, the appellants made a written request to the provincial prosecutor and to the Edmonton office of the Department of Justice, requesting that provincial and federal authorities disclose whether either of the appellants were named as primary or secondary targets in any undisclosedCriminal Code, Part VI electronic interceptions during the period 1988 to April 15, 1992.  5Counsel representing the provincial and federal governments notified the appellants that: (a)there were no provincial wiretap authorizations in effect pertaining to this particular investigation during the time period in question; (b)the provincial Crown declined to confirm or deny the existence of any other provincial authorization that may have been in existence during the same time period; and (c)the federal Crown refused to confirm or deny the existence of any such authorization during the relevant time period that may have been obtained in relation to matters under federal jurisdiction.  It is very significant that the Crown disclosed that there were no wiretap authorizations pertaining to the investigation of the charges being tried in the time period in question.  6As a result of the Crown's refusal, the appellants applied for an order directing the Crown to answer the following question:  During the period 1988 to April 15, 1992, were we [the appellants] named as either primary or secondary targets of any authorizations to intercept private communications granted in Edmonton or elsewhere in Alberta or in British Columbia?  In their application, the appellants also requested that, if they were in fact named as primary or secondary targets in any such authorizations, the Crown disclose to them the authorizations, the supporting affidavits and documents, the logs, transcripts, records, copies of all recordings, and names and status of each person involved in the surveillance.  7After an issue as to presentation of evidence relied upon in support of the application and two adjournments, the application proceeded as aStinchcombeapplication as to whether the appellants had an absolute right to ask the question and expect an answer. The trial court heard the application on the basis of argument on first principles, and if first principles failed, the parties would be permitted to call evidence to address the issue of whether disclosure was required.  8The appellants' reasons for seeking disclosure from the Crown were three-fold: (a)to permit them to establish an evidentiary foundation for invoking the exclusionary rule in s. 189(2) of theCodedealing with derivative evidence; (b)to prepare for cross-examination of witnesses and fully explore the nature of the Crown's case in order to secure their right to a fair hearing as mandated bys. 7of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and (c)to determine whether their constitutionally mandated rights to a fair trial and consultation with counsel in private have been violated by police interception of privileged communications between them and their lawyers contrary toss. 7,10(b), and11(d)of theCharter.  The respondent's reasons for refusing disclosure were: (a)to answer the question would effectively bar investigating bodies from the use of wiretap authorizations against persons charged with an offence or who may be charged with an offence if the only basis for the demand needs to be speculation without the necessity of showing any nexus between the disclosure sought and the case the accused is facing; (b)an answer to the question would not conclude the matter and the question could be raised up to the end of the trial; and (c)the circumstances of this case did not clearly trigger any of the provisions of s. 193(2).  The intervener's reasons for objecting to disclosure of the requested information were based on its lack of relevance and on public interest privilege.  9At the application, the respondent submitted that this was aCharterapplication and consequently that the onus was on the appellants to demonstrate aCharterbreach. In aStinchcombeapplication, the initial onus of demonstrating the relevance to their case of the requested information was on the accuseds. The appellants admitted that they had no evidence to demonstrate the relevance to their defence of the information sought since they had no proof that there had been any wiretap authorizations or that there was derivative evidence obtained therefrom relevant to the charges. The appellants argued, however, that once the accused has made aStinchcombeapplication for disclosure, the onus was on the Crown to justify its refusal to disclose on the basis that the material was clearly irrelevant, or raised public interest privilege.  10The intervener, who had been brought into the proceedings on the appellants' motion requesting an order for disclosure of federal wiretap investigations, was granted leave to intervene in the Alberta Court of Appeal. The Attorney General of Canada was also granted leave to intervene in this Court.  11The respondent's application to quash the appellants' notice of appeal as of right pursuant to s. 691(2)(a), asserting that the judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal setting aside a stay of proceeding and directing a new trial did not give rise to an appeal as of right, was dismissed by this Court on March 4, 1994.

        "Facts": " 5In early November 1991, the complainant and the respondent met in a parking lot when the respondent helped her remove her car from an icy spot.  He asked for her phone number.  She agreed.  Approximately one week later, on November 12, they went out on a date and subsequently returned to her place.  He says that they became quite intimate, removed substantially all of their clothing, fondled one another's private parts, talked of sex and birth control, and that she masturbated him to ejaculation.  She maintains that they only kissed, talked of birth control, and talked about the fact that, as a born again Christian, she did not believe in premarital sex.  Nothing else happened and he left at around 9:45 p.m.  6Thirteen days later, on November 25, the respondent, having driven all night from Winnipeg, called the complainant up at six in the morning from his cellular phone and asked if he could stop by.  Although she had just gotten up for work, she assented since she thought he needed to talk.  He arrived ten minutes later, having stopped to buy a condom at a nearby store.  She greeted him at the door with a kiss on the cheek, clad only in her bathrobe.  He entered and beckoned her to the couch and tried to kiss her.  At this point, their stories diverge considerably.  7According to her, she pulled away and, seeing the condom in his hand, asked if that was \"why [he] came over here\".  Distraught, she went to her room to take her sleeping 2-year-old child off her bed and took her to another room to change the child's diapers.  The respondent followed her.  After she had finished, he beckoned the complainant into the bedroom.  She followed, thinking that he wanted to \"crash\", since he had driven all night before arriving at her door.  She began to look in her closet for clothes to wear to work when she turned around and saw that the respondent had taken his shirt off.  She claims that he drew her to him and kissed her and then pushed her onto the bed.  She resisted actively, both verbally and physically, but he was stronger.  She described in considerable detail the assault.  Feeling his weight atop her, she had a flashback to a previous traumatic experience and went into \"shock\".  The next thing she remembered, he was pulling his penis out of her and ejaculating on her stomach.  She fled to the bathroom, needing to vomit.  He dressed and kissed her goodbye on the cheek as he left.  The complainant did not go to work that day, but instead went directly to see her counsellor, who testified to the fact of her emotionally agitated state on that particular day.  8By contrast, the respondent claims that they sat on her couch and kissed, and that he then asked to use the washroom.  The complainant then took her sleeping child back to the child's bedroom, and the two of them entered the complainant's bedroom where they lay on the bed and began to kiss.  She actively participated in the sexual activity.  Her only resistance was that, when he pulled out the condom, she said \"no, not yet\".  He therefore put the condom aside on the pillow.  In his words, things then began to get \"hot\" and he prematurely ejaculated on her stomach.  No intercourse took place.  They talked for a short period of time.  She got up and went to the bathroom.  He dressed, kissed her goodbye and left.  9At trial, the respondent asserted that the complainant consented to the sexual activity or, in the alternative, that he had an honest but mistaken belief that she was consenting.  Both the complainant and the respondent testified.  A report from the medical examination of the complainant was admitted into evidence in an agreed-upon statement of facts.  That report indicated no physical injury, but noted the presence of redness on the inner labia which could be consistent with either consensual or non-consensual intercourse.  The trial judge refused to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury, finding there to be no air of reality to the defence, and concluding that the issue was simply one of \"consent or no consent\".  Because of his ruling on the mistaken belief defence, he also instructed the jury to disregard all evidence of any sexual activity between the complainant and the respondent prior to the alleged incident, since it was not relevant to any other issue in the trial.  The respondent was convicted.  10McClung J.A., for the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal (1993), 145 A.R. 207, 55 W.A.C. 207, held the trial judge's failure to put the mistaken belief defence to the jury to be in error.  He enumerated certain independent facts that, in his view, lent an air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent: the complainant's telephone overture to the respondent, the discussions of her use of birth control, and the fact that she met him with a kiss at 6:10 a.m. on November 25 wearing only her bathrobe. He also held the trial judge's instruction that the jury disregard the prior sexual activity to be in error, since it was relevant to the question of mistaken belief.  McFadyen J.A. dissented on the basis that none of the factors pointed to by the majority lent any air of reality to the defence.

        "Facts": " 1The respondent was charged with possession of LSD for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 48(2) of theFood and Drugs Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-27.  He was also charged with failing to comply with the terms of a recognizance contrary tos. 145(3)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.  2On October 3, 1991, a search warrant was executed at the respondent's residence which he was renting.  The respondent in turn sublet two rooms of the house to Kenneth Thelland and John Paciocco.  All three men had the use of the living room and kitchen areas of the house.  As a result of the search, the police discovered a clear plastic zip-lock bag containing sheets of blotting paper impregnated with 682 \"hits\" of LSD.  3At the time of the search and seizure Thelland was upstairs in his room and the respondent was in the living room with his girlfriend.  The bag containing the drugs was found under a couch in the living room where the respondent and his girlfriend had been sitting.  The only identifiable fingerprints on the bag were those of the respondent.  The police also found LSD blotter paper located in stereo speakers in Thelland's bedroom which was very similar in design to the blotter paper containing the LSD found under the couch.  A five-gram vial of hash oil was also discovered in Thelland's bedroom, along with ten \"hits\" of LSD in a wallet that Thelland was using.  The LSD was on paper of the same design as that found in the living room.  In the same wallet, the police discovered a list of names with various amounts of money opposite each name.  4Thelland told the police that he was the owner of the bag containing the drugs which were found under the couch.  Furthermore, while Thelland was being transported to the police station, he advised one of the officers that he sold LSD in bulk lots of 25 \"hits\".  After being cautioned, Thelland signed an inculpatory statement reiterating that he was the owner of the contents of the zip-lock bag.  Thelland was jointly charged with the respondent.  5Thelland swore an affidavit admitting liability for the drugs in order to support the respondent's application for bail.  However, eight months after his arrest, Thelland went to the police station and recanted all his previous statements.  The charges against the respondent and Thelland were severed.  Thelland was tried first before Pardu J. of the Ontario Court (General Division), and was acquitted of the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking.  6At the respondent's trial, which was also held before Pardu J., Thelland testified on behalf of the Crown.  The explanation offered by Thelland for lying on his previous confessions was that he was a friend of the respondent.  Thelland stated that during the police search, while in the kitchen, he told the respondent that he would take the blame for the offences.  However, upon later realizing how serious the charge was, Thelland concluded that \"it wasn't worth it\".  Thus, he went to the police and recanted his confessions.  Thelland also stated that the drugs belonged to the respondent.  He indicated that the basis of this knowledge was that he had seen the respondent dealing in drugs in the past.  7At trial, Thelland stated that he had no knowledge of the LSD border paper found in his room and that the LSD paper must have already been in the speakers when he purchased them from a friend, whom he declined to name.  Thelland also testified that the wallet he was using belonged to Paciocco and he had no knowledge of the list of names found in it.  He further denied that he was the owner of the LSD found under the sofa.  He testified that he was on welfare and could not afford to buy a large quantity of drugs.  However, Thelland admitted that the hash oil and the ten \"hits\" of LSD found in his room were for his personal use.  8Thelland agreed that it was possible that the zip-lock bag found under the couch could have come from a drawer in the kitchen to which everyone had access, although there was no evidence whether the respondent did, in fact, handle plastic bags in the kitchen.  Paciocco was not called by the Crown and the respondent did not testify.  9The respondent was convicted on both counts and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months on the first count and to a consecutive term of two months on the second count.  The respondent appealed his conviction and applied for leave to appeal his sentence.  The majority of the Court of Appeal, Finlayson J.A. dissenting, allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial at the discretion of the Crown: (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 43, 68 O.A.C. 58. ",

        "Facts": " 39The second such instance arises when an offender is convicted of a number of distinct counts in relation to a single offence or in relation to a set of different offences.  In such situations, s. 717(4)(c) of theCodeempowers a trial judge to order that certain numerical sentences be served consecutively as opposed to concurrently.  In the presence of such an order, an offender could quite easily be forced to serve a cumulative fixed-term sentence well beyond 14 years, depending on the number of counts and the maximum sentence associated with each count.  But once again, theCodefalls silent as to whether or not there is an upper limit on cumulative sentences in our criminal law.  40In both such circumstances, notwithstanding the lack of any explicit statutory ceiling on numerical sentences, Canadian courts have generally refrained from exploring whether there is indeed a limit on fixed-term sentences under theCode.  Rather, guided by the legal obligation that a term of imprisonment be \"just and appropriate\" under the circumstances, courts have generally avoided imposing excessively harsh and onerous sentences which might test the potential legal ceilings governing the imposition of sentence.  It is a well-established tenet of our criminal law that the quantum of sentence imposed should be broadly commensurate with the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.  As Wilson J. expressed in her concurring judgment inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 533:  It is basic to any theory of punishment that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a \"fit\" sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence.  Only if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender \"deserved\" the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the fairness and rationality of the system.  Cory J. similarly acknowledged the importance of \"the principle of proportionality\" in speaking for the Court inR.v.M. (J.J.), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421, at p. 431, noting that \"[i]t is true that for both adults and minors the sentence must be proportional to the offence committed\".  Indeed, the principle of proportionality in punishment is fundamentally connected to the general principle of criminal liability which holds that the criminal sanction may only be imposed on those actors who possess a morally culpable state of mind.  In discussing the constitutional requirement of fault for murder inR.v.Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645, I noted the related principle that \"punishment must be proportionate to the moral blameworthiness of the offender\", and that \"those causing harm intentionally [should] be punished more severely than those causing harm unintentionally\".  On the principle of proportionality generally, seeR. v. Wilmott, [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171, at pp. 178-79 (Ont. C.A.);Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach,supra, at p. 154.  41Within broader parameters, the principle of proportionality expresses itself as a constitutional obligation.  As this Court has recognized on numerous occasions, a legislative or judicial sentence that is grossly disproportionate, in the sense that it is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency, will violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment unders. 12of theCharter.  SeeSmith,supra, at p. 1072;R.v.Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, at p. 724;R.v.Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at pp. 498-99.   However, as I noted inSmith, at p. 1072, \"[w]e should be careful not to stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a constitutional violation\", and thus the review of the proportionality of sentences should normally be left to the \"usual sentencing appeal process\" directed at the fitness of sentence.  42In the context of consecutive sentences, this general principle of proportionality expresses itself through the more particular form of the \"totality principle\".  The totality principle, in short, requires a sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender.  As D. A. Thomas describes the principle inPrinciples of Sentencing(2nd ed. 1979), at p. 56:  The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is \"just and appropriate\".  Clayton Ruby articulates the principle in the following terms in his treatise,Sentencing,supra, at pp. 44-45:  The purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in aggregate \"just and appropriate\".  A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender \"a crushing sentence\" not in keeping with his record and prospects.  43Whether under the rubric of the \"totality principle\" or a more generalized principle of proportionality, Canadian courts have been reluctant to impose single and consecutive fixed-term sentences beyond 20 years.  See M. E. Rice, \"Fixed-Term Sentences of More Than 20 Years Versus Life Imprisonment\" (1994), 36Crim. L.Q.474, at p. 474, n. 1.  As Rice has noted, as a matter of practice, provincial courts of appeal have only been willing to sustain sentences in excess of 20 years on rare occasions.  See, e.g.,R.v.Saumer, [1977] 3 W.W.R. 385 (B.C.C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 25 years for robbery);R.v.Nichols(1978), 9 A.R. 203 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 27 years for robbery);R.v.Belmas, Hansen and Taylor(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (B.C.C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 22 years for terrorist activities);R.v.Gorham(1987), 22 O.A.C. 237 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 23 years for robbery and firearms);R.v.Currie(1990), 98 N.S.R. (2d) 287 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 26 years for robbery and sexual assault);Yazdaniv. La Reine,[1992] R.J.Q. 2385 (C.A.) (cumulative sentence of 25 years for heroin importation).  More commonly, sentences in excess of 20 years imposed at trial have been reduced to beneath 20 years on appeal, often through reference to the principle of totality.  See, e.g.,R.v.Velmurugu(1994), 74 O.A.C. 393 (C.A.);R.v.Parsons(1993), 24 C.R. (4th) 112 (Ont. C.A.);R.v.Pelletier(1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 340 (Que. C.A.);R.v.Charest(1989), 30 Q.A.C. 227;R.v.Childs(1984), 52 N.B.R. (2d) 9 (C.A.).  44In contrast to the absence of any explicit codal rules governing the limits on fixed-term sentences of imprisonment, theCriminal Code, read together with theCorrections Act, sets very clear rules governing the determination of parole eligibility.  A person sentenced to a numerical term of imprisonment under theCode(i.e., not life) becomes eligible for full parole after serving the lesser of one third of the sentence or seven years.  As s. 120(1) of theCorrections Actreads:  120.(1)  Subject tosections 747and761of theCriminal Codeand to any order made under section 741.2 of that Act, the portion of a sentence of imprisonment that must be served before an offender may be released on full parole is the lesser of ",

        "Facts": " 2The appellant, a police officer in Windsor, was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary tos. 267(1)(b) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.  The victim, Gerald Smith, was taking out his garbage one evening when the appellant drove by in his police cruiser and asked Smith for identification. Smith refused, stating that he lived there. The appellant got out of the car and attempted to arrest the victim and a struggle ensued.  3At trial, there was an issue as to whether or not the assault was racially motivated.  In a decision released on March 23, 1992, Haines J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, found that the appellant had used excessive force in making a lawful arrest but that the offence was not racially motivated. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(1)(b) of theCode. On April 3, 1992, he granted the appellant a conditional discharge with probation for 18 months.  4In sentencing the appellant, Haines J. concluded that he was compelled by the mandatory wording of s. 100 of theCodeto make an order prohibiting the possession of a firearm. Haines J. stated that it was \"truly unfortunate\" that he had to impose a prohibition order, as this could defeat the rehabilitative purpose of the conditional discharge in that the appellant being a police officer could not continue that employment unless he was able to possess a firearm.  Haines J. imposed the prohibition for the minimum period of 5 years.  5The appellant appealed from both the conviction and the firearms prohibition. The respondent appealed the granting of the conditional discharge.  The appeals were heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal on December 22, 1993.  6Prior to the hearing of the appeal, on August 1, 1992, an amendment to s. 100 of theCodewas proclaimed.  The amendment had been passed by Parliament before sentencing in this case but had not been proclaimed.  The new s. 100 removed the mandatory nature of the order under s. 100 and permitted the exercise of discretion by the court in certain limited circumstances, which the appellant claimed were applicable to him.  The appeal was heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal with the appeal in the similar case ofR. v. Luke(1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 51. ",

        ],
        "Facts": " 36Notwithstanding the many weaknesses in the evidence given by C., the trial judge found C. to be a credible witness.  According to the trial judge, C.'s \"impreciseness respecting dates\" did not \"lessen his credibility\" (p. 298).  In addition, the trial judge found that C.'s past dishonesty  did not bring C.'s credibility into question.  As a result, the trial judge accepted C.'s evidence and found it to corroborate the evidence of E. in respect of the \"ointment incident\".  The accused was therefore convicted of having indecently assaulted both complainants.  It is significant that the trial judge was not prepared to accept E.'s evidence except in respect of the one incident which was, in her view, corroborated by C.  37In my view, the obvious inconsistencies and falsehoods in the testimony of C. render the trial judge's finding of credibility unreasonable.  I simply cannot accept that any trier of fact, acting judicially, could have found any merit in the claims of either C. or E.  Moreover, given the frailties in the evidence of these two witnesses and the strong possibility of collusion, reliance by the trial judge on the evidence of C. to corroborate E.'s testimony was unreasonable.  38In finding that there was no collaboration between the complainants C. and E., the trial judge stressed the fact that C. had never had access to the newspaper reports in which E.'s statements had appeared.  Because there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that C. had learned the details of E.'s allegations through the media, the trial judge held that C.'s account of abuse had not been tainted by prior knowledge of the statements made by E.  With respect, this ignores the possibility that C. may have learned the details of E.'s story through contact with their common lawyer, Harry Kopyto.  The trial judge appears to have failed to notice that both complainants had been in contact with Kopyto.  Without referring to the obvious possibility of contact through a common lawyer, the trial judge took the view that there was \"no evidence that prior to [S.E.] or [D.C.] making their respective complaints to the police there was any contact between the two\" (p. 300).  Clearly, contact between the complainants and Harry Kopyto constitutes evidence of possible contact between the complainants, or at least the possibility that C. was exposed to the details of E.'s allegations.  Obviously, this raises a risk or possibility that C.'s claims against the accused arose from his knowledge of the statements made by E.  39There is a considerable body of authority to the effect that when an issue of the possibility of collusion or collaboration is raised, evidence of similar acts should not be admitted absent a finding by the trial judge that there is no real possibility of collusion or collaboration.  SeeCross on Evidence(7th ed. 1990), at pp. 364-65, andHoch v. The Queen(1988), 165 C.L.R. 292 (H.C. Austr.).  40InDirector of Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421 (H.L.), at p. 444, Lord Wilberforce stated that where a real possibility of collusion can be found:  ... something much more than mere similarity and absence of proved conspiracy is needed if this evidence is to be allowed.  This is well illustrated byReg.v.Kilbourne[1973] A.C. 529 where the judge excluded \"intra group\" evidence because of the possibility,as it appeared to him, of collaboration between boys who knew each other well.  This is, in my respectful opinion, the right course rather than to admit the evidence unless a case of collaboration or concoction is made out.  [Emphasis in original.]  41As a result of its more recent decisions inDirector of Public Prosecutions v. P., [1991] 2 A.C. 447, andR. v. H., [1995] 2 A.C. 596, the House of Lords is now of the view that, generally, the possibility of collusion is not a factor to be applied by the trial judge in determining the admissibility of this type of evidence.  This Court has not decided the question although it was my view in my dissent inR. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, that before similar fact evidence is admitted, the risk of collusion must be negatived by a finding by the trial judge.  The majority did not express an opinion on the point.  42The appellant did not contest the mutual admissibility of the evidence of E. and C. in respect of the counts relating to each.  It is therefore not appropriate for this Court to attempt to resolve this difficult legal question in this case.  But, assuming the evidence is admissible, the question arises as to what weight, if any, ought to have been given to it as corroborative evidence.  43This question was considered by the House of Lords inR. v. H.,supra.  The appellant was charged in separate counts with sexual offences committed upon his adopted daughter and stepdaughter respectively.  There existed sufficient similarity between the evidence of the two complainants to meet this requirement for admission as similar act evidence.  Admissibility was, however, contested on the ground that a real possibility of collusion existed.  The trial judge directed the jury that, if they were sure that the complainants had not collaborated, then the evidence of one of them could corroborate that of the other.  The House of Lords dismissed an appeal from a judgment upholding the charge.  Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. stated, at p. 612, that where a question of  collusion has been raised the judge must clearly draw the importance of collusion to the attention of the jury and leave it to them to decide whether, notwithstanding such evidence of collusion as may have been put before them, they are satisfied that the evidence can be relied upon as free from collusion and tell them that if they are not so satisfied they cannot properly rely upon it as corroboration or for any other purpose adverse to the defence.  44Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead agreed with Lord Mackay.  Lord Griffiths and Lord Mustill would apparently have left it to the jury to determine what weight, if any, should be given to the evidence.  The majority reasons of Lord Mackay would, therefore, leave it to the jury to decide as a preliminary question of fact whether the evidence is tainted by collusion.  If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence must be disregarded.  This would in effect leave it to the jury to decide whether the evidence was admissible.  While unusual, a similar approach has been approved by this Court in relation to the co-conspirator exceptions to the hearsay rule.  SeeR. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938.  See alsoR. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653.  The more conventional approach adopted by Lords Griffiths and Mustill is that once the trial judge decides that the evidence is admissible, it is the trier of fact who determines what weight, if any, is to be given to the evidence having regard to all the circumstances, including the possibility of collusion.

        ],
        "Facts": " 3The facts and judgments relevant to this appeal may be briefly summarized.  Crosby and Rines were tried separately.  At Crosby's trial, which is the subject matter of this appeal, the complainant testified that she had been attacked by both men and forced to engage in non-consensual sexual acts with both.  By contrast, Crosby testified that the complainant had consented throughout.  The defence theory was that the complainant had fabricated the allegation of sexual assault against Crosby and Rines after she was confronted by her parents about her sexual activities.  This theory was supported by the fact that the complainant only reported the sexual assault to police after her brother heard rumours of her sexual activities with Crosby and reported them to her parents, who then confronted her about them.  The defence submitted that the complainant made up the story that she had been sexually assaulted because she was too embarrassed and ashamed to admit that she consented to sexual activities with two men.  The defence did not raise at trial the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.  4In avoir direbefore the commencement of the trial, the defence sought permission from the trial judge to lead evidence or cross-examine the complainant on four different statements, all of which referred in some way to sexual activity other than that which formed the subject matter of the charge, and which thereby triggered s. 276 scrutiny.  The trial judge allowed evidence to be led on one of the four statements, and excluded the other three.  Crosby was convicted of sexual assault.  5Crosby appealed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on the basis that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence of the other three statements.  The majority of that court upheld his conviction ((1994), 130 N.S.R. (2d) 61).  Hallett J.A., dissenting, would have ordered a new trial on the basis that two of the three excluded statements regarding unrelated sexual conduct were relevant because they tended to prove a motive to fabricate.  Crosby appeals as of right to this Court.

        "Facts": " 2The appellant, F.J.U., emigrated from Peru to Canada in 1975, shortly after the birth of his daughter J.U.  His daughter remained in Peru with her grandmother C.O.-V., the appellant's mother, until December 1987, when they both joined the appellant in Canada.  The three shared a residence in Mississauga along with the appellant's brother until the spring of 1988, when C.O.-V. returned to Peru and the appellant and his daughter moved to Brampton.  In September 1988, C.O.-V. returned to Canada, and from September 1988 to October 11, 1988 (the date of the appellant’s arrest) she resided with the appellant and J.U. in Toronto.  3On October 11, 1988, C.O.-V. reported to the police that the appellant had engaged in sexual activities with his daughter.  The police went to the U.'s residence, in the company of a Spanish interpreter, and spoke to J.U.  The appellant was arrested and taken to the police station.  J.U. and her grandmother were taken to the police station in a separate car.  4After arriving at the police station, J.U. was interviewed by Sergeant Hector Colantoni, the investigating officer.  Her grandmother was present during the interview, as was Constable Tom Job, a Spanish-speaking officer who acted as an interpreter when J.U. had difficulty understanding Sergeant Colantoni's questions or responding to them in English.  In the course of the interview, J.U. stated that her father had been having sexual intercourse with her on a regular basis since December 1987 when she came to Canada.  She told the police that these incidents occurred more frequently after her grandmother had returned to Peru in April 1988, and that between this date and her grandmother’s return to Canada in September 1988 her father had sex with her “almost every day”.  She declared that the sexual activity generally took place late at night in her bedroom.  She also indicated that on a few occasions the appellant had had her perform oral sex on him, and that on a few other occasions he had performed oral sex on her.  In addition, she stated, the appellant \"would have sex in my bum many times\".  The last time her father had had sex with her, she declared, was the previous night (October 10, 1988).  J.U. also stated that the appellant had physically assaulted her on two separate occasions, the first time striking her with a length of wire, and the second time punching her in the face.  At the appellant's trial, Sergeant Colantoni testified that he had attempted to tape his interview with J.U., but that the tape recorder had malfunctioned and nothing had been recorded.  He stated that he had subsequently prepared a summary of J.U.'s anticipated evidence, based in part on notes he had made during the interview and in part on his memory.  5After interviewing J.U., Sergeant Colantoni proceeded to question the appellant, accompanied by Constable Tony McKenzie.  Sergeant Colantoni testified that he took notes and that the interview was not taped.  According to Sergeant Colantoni's testimony, the appellant admitted that he had had sex with his daughter “many times”, and also stated that she had performed oral sex on him “two or three times when we lived in Mississauga, but she didn't like it”.  He also declared that he had performed oral sex on her “once or twice”.  Sergeant Colantoni also testified that the appellant had further admitted to having had anal sex with J.U. “three or four times”, stating that this had taken place most recently “last night” (i.e., October 10, 1988).  The appellant also described two incidents in which he had physically assaulted his daughter, stating that on one occasion he had struck her with a wire-reinforced belt, and that on the second occasion he had slapped her in the face.  The appellant refused, however, to make a written statement, and indicated that he would not sign anything.  6The appellant was charged with three counts of sexual interference (s. 151, of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46), one count of incest (s. 155) and one count of anal intercourse (s. 159).  The terms of the indictment were particularized as follows:   Count 1:Touching the mouth of J.U. with his penis for a sexual purpose, between September 1 and October 10, 1988, in Toronto.  Count 2:Anal intercourse with J.U. on or about October 10, 1988, in Toronto.  Count 3:Incest with J.U. between September 1 and October 10, 1988, in Toronto.  Count 4:Touching the mouth of J.U. with his penis for a sexual purpose, between September 1, 1987 and August 31, 1988, in Toronto and Mississauga.  Count 5:Touching J.U.'s vagina with his mouth for a sexual purpose, between September 1, 1987 and August 31, 1988, in Toronto and Mississauga.  7The appellant was tried in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) before a jury, with Allen J. presiding.  His statement to the police, which Allen J. ruled had been made voluntarily and obtained in accordance with theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was admitted as Crown evidence through the testimony of Sergeant Colantoni and Constable McKenzie.  The Crown also called J.U. as a witness.  Although she admitted that she had made the allegations against the appellant contained in the “will-say” statement that had been drafted by Sergeant Colantoni following his interview with her, J.U. asserted that the allegations of sexual assault were untrue.  She maintained, however, that the allegations of non-sexual assault she had made in her statement were true.  According to J.U.'s trial testimony, she had lied to the police at the behest of her grandmother, because she was concerned that her father was planning to send her back to Peru to live with her mother.  She stated that her grandmother had threatened to commit suicide if J.U. were taken away from her, and had given J.U. instructions about details of the false allegations of sexual misconduct she was to make.  8The appellant also testified at trial.  While he admitted having made an inculpatory statement to the police, he denied the truth of much of the statement's contents.  He testified that the conduct of the police during the interview had brought back memories of his imprisonment and torture by the Peruvian police, and that his resulting fear had led him to make a false confession.  He believed that as long as he refused to sign anything his confession could not be used against him.  9When cross-examined on his statement, the appellant denied having made several of the utterances attributed to him by Sergeant Colantoni and Constable McKenzie.  In particular, he denied having told the officers that he had had anal intercourse with his daughter, or telling them that his sexual activity with J.U. was intended to \"protect\" her from having sex with other people.  While he agreed that the remainder of the officers' testimony accurately reflected what he had said to them, he testified that none of his admissions of having engaged in sexual activity with his daughter were true.  He confirmed, however, that the portion of his statement describing the two physical assaults on his daughter was true.  10After deliberating for over nine hours, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on counts 1 and 2 and guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5.  The appellant was sentenced to a term of incarceration of two years less one day, and to a period of probation.  The appellant's appeal of his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed, Houlden J.A. dissenting: (1994), 90 C.C.C.

        "Facts": " 3While driving home from work in the early morning hours of March 5, 1985, Michael Crispin stopped on the side of Queen Street West to offer assistance to a fellow motorist in a disabled motor vehicle.  When Mr. Crispin emerged from his car to help the motorist, the appellant and two accomplices waylaid the good Samaritan and forced him back into his Lincoln Continental.  The appellant and his accomplices (Vince and Racky) were in possession of a shotgun, which they used to force Mr. Crispin to comply with their demands.  Witnesses in the area heard Mr. Crispin cry \"No gun, I want to live\".  As the appellant and his accomplices drove Mr. Crispin away in the Continental, witnesses could hear the sound of a gunshot fired within the car.  4Approximately one hour after accosting Mr. Crispin, the appellant and his cohorts attempted several bank transactions at an automated teller using Mr. Crispin's card.  The appellant and his friends withdrew $200 from Crispin's account, indicating that they had somehow obtained Crispin's personal banking number.  5At approximately 5:00 a.m., Constable Vandenburg of the Durham Regional Police observed the appellant and his accomplices at a convenience store in Whitby.  Crispin's Lincoln Continental was idling in the parking lot of the store.  Constable Vandenburg observed the appellant and his friends for several minutes, watching them eventually drive away.  6After following the Continental for a brief period, Constable Vandenburg finally stopped the appellant and his companions.  The appellant was driving the vehicle, and produced identification at the request of Constable Vandenburg.  The identification in question was that of Michael Crispin, the man who had just been killed by the appellant and his cohorts.  Constable Vandenburg examined the identification produced by the appellant, and asked the appellant to state his name.  The appellant replied that his name was \"Christopher\".  The name on the identification given to Constable Vandenburg was \"Michael\".  Constable Vandenburg, suspecting that something was afoot, escorted the appellant to the police cruiser and asked him several questions.  7Based on the appellant's answers to his inquiries, Constable Vandenburg arrested the appellant for possession of stolen property.  The constable searched the appellant and discovered live shotgun ammunition on his person.  8With the assistance of a back-up unit, Constable Vandenburg returned to the Lincoln Continental and arrested the appellant's cohorts, Vince and Racky.  When the Continental was searched, the police discovered a loaded sawed-off shotgun beneath the passenger seat in the front of the car.  9At approximately 6:55 a.m., the appellant and his accomplices were escorted to a police station where the appellant was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon and obstructing the police.  The appellant denied any knowledge of Michael Crispin, and claimed that he had obtained Crispin's vehicle from \"[t]he guy at the Parkdale Hotel\".  When questioned about the live shotgun shells in his possession, the appellant offered no explanation aside from the fact that the shells \"weren't in the gun\".  10Michael Crispin's body was eventually discovered on March 11, 1985.  His corpse was found in an isolated area in Durham.  A scarf had been used to \"gag\" Mr. Crispin, who had a gaping head wound consistent with a point-blank shotgun blast.  11The appellant's coat was subjected to forensic examination, which revealed five specks of tissue which were consistent with the body of the deceased.  In addition, the legs of the appellant's pants were found to be wet, as if the appellant had been walking in an area covered with snow such as the one in which Mr. Crispin's body was found.  One of the appellant's cohorts (Mr. Vince) eventually confessed to having fired the fatal shot into Crispin's head.  12Because the appellant was a party to the offences of unlawful confinement and robbery which led to the death of Mr. Crispin, the appellant was clearly guilty of \"constructive murder\" or \"felony murder\" unders. 213(d) of theCriminal Code.  The appellant pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of second degree murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the potential for parole for 15 years.  Mr. Vince was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison without parole for 25 years.  Miss Racky, who could not be placed at the scene of the crime at the time that Crispin was killed, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison.  13Eleven months after the appellant entered his plea of guilty to the offence of second degree murder, this Court rendered its judgment inVaillancourt, supra.  In that case, the Court concluded thats. 213(d) of theCriminal Code(the provision under which the appellant was convicted) was inconsistent withs. 7of theCharter.  As a result of that conclusion,s. 213(d) of theCriminal Codewas struck down pursuant tos. 52of theConstitution Act, 1982.  14Two and one-half years after theVaillancourtdecision, the appellant sought leave before the Ontario Court of Appeal to extend the time in which he could appeal his conviction and sentence, on the basis that the provision under which he had been convicted was struck down.  This application for an extension of time was refused.  The appellant also brought an application forhabeas corpuswithcertiorariin aid, seeking various orders quashing his warrant of committal and declaring him immediately eligible for parole.  This application was refused by Watt J. of the Ontario Court (General Division): (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  Watt J.'s decision was upheld by the unanimous Court of Appeal: (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 95.  The appellant now appeals hishabeas corpusapplication to this Court. ",

The police found an empty litre-bottle of red wine in his apartment.  4According to the respondent's statement to the police, he stabbed the deceased in self-defence.  The deceased apparently said something to the respondent who then struck the deceased on the head with a rock from his pocket. The respondent then went to the kitchen, returned with a bread knife and was standing with the knife in his right hand.  The respondent remembered stabbing the deceased two times and pushing him back into his chair.   5The stabbing was witnessed by two other individuals.  One of these witnesses, a self-described panhandler and street person of no fixed address, testified that both the deceased and the respondent had been drinking and that the respondent was very drunk.  At some point, the deceased told another individual present to \"get rid of your two friends\" and the respondent then hit the deceased on the head with a rock.  According to this witness, the deceased never stood up and remained in his chair as the respondent stabbed the deceased.  6In final submissions to the jury, defence counsel submitted that the most important issue in the case was how the jury was going to deal with the defence of intoxication.  Crown counsel conceded that the respondent was under some degree of influence of intoxication.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge told them that intoxication in this case was \"significant\" and there was evidence that the respondent \"consumed a considerable amount of alcohol before the alleged killing of Mr. Clark Hall.\"  7The respondent was convicted of second degree murder by a jury.  He appealed his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal primarily on the basis that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on the manner in which they could use the evidence of intoxication as it related to the requisite intent for murder.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and the Crown appealed that decision to this Court on the basis of Gibbs J.A.'s dissent and pursuant to leave granted on March 2, 1995 ([1995] 1 S.C.R. x).

Ct. J. ordered the exclusion of the public and the media, with the exception of the accused, the victims, their immediate families and a victim services coordinator, from those parts of the sentencing proceedings dealing with the specific acts committed by Carson.  The exclusion order remained in effect for approximately 20 minutes.  The order was sought on the basis of the nature of the evidence, which the court had not yet heard, and which purportedly established that the offence was of a“very delicate”nature.  Crown counsel further pointed to the fact that the case involved young, female persons.  3.         André Veniot, a CBC reporter, was excluded from the court along with the other members of the media and the public.  Shortly after the public had been invited to reattend the proceedings, a lawyer retained by Veniot was granted permission to address the court.  She requested that Rice Prov. Ct. J. give reasons for making the exclusion order.  In maintaining his order, Rice Prov. Ct. J. stated that it had been rendered in the interests of the proper administration of justice; it would avoid undue hardship to the victims and the accused. ",

A.       Yeah.  Q.       All right.  And were you able to recognize anyone, sir?  A.       Yeah.  I suspect this man -- and either this one or this one -- I think this one.

        "Facts": " 2Since the appellant, Harley McMaster, is also asking this Court to assess the reasonableness of his verdict, I will set out the facts of this case in some detail.  3Harley McMaster was convicted, along with his cousin Randy McMaster, of second degree murder following a trial without a jury before Brennan J. of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench.  The charges arose from a severe beating which occurred in the early hours of October 21, 1992, in an area behind a YWCA in downtown Calgary.  The deceased was found lying on his back in a pool of blood.  He had suffered severe facial lacerations; in fact, the deceased's face was so mutilated that the emergency medical technician was unable at first to tell whether the victim was a man or a woman.  The deceased died some time later in the hospital.  (i)Evidence of the Assault  4The main Crown witness, Art Collins, testified that in the early morning of October 21, 1992, he stopped at a set of traffic lights by the Cecil Hotel.  He saw three men cross the street.  The men appeared to be arguing. Collins felt there was going to be a confrontation so he parked his vehicle in the hotel parking lot and went across the street to the park beside the YWCA.  At trial he estimated that he was about 30 feet away from the three men.  He testified that the lighting was not too bad and that he had a pretty clear view.  5He saw two men assaulting another individual.  Both of the men were kicking and hitting the victim.  Collins told them to stop, which they did momentarily, but then continued the beating.  The taller of the assailants appeared to be kicking the victim in the head while the shorter one kicked him in the body.  Before they moved off, the shorter one was on his knees hitting the victim with his fists.  Collins testified that he could see the kicking and punching very clearly.  The taller assailant had long dark hair.  The shorter one had what appeared to be a black jacket with a long T-shirt hanging below it.  In court, Collins misidentified Harley McMaster as the taller of the two assailants.  6Collins went to a cab parked by the hotel and asked the driver to call the police.  The driver moved his vehicle to shine its lights into the park area. The beating stopped at this point.  The two assailants proceeded out the gate to the park, leaving the victim on the ground.  The police arrived almost immediately and Collins pointed out, to the police, the assailants, who were moving away from the scene.  7Godfrey Daniell, the cab driver, testified that while he was parked at the Cecil Hotel, he was approached by a man about the disturbance which had been going on across the street.  Daniell called the police first.  At some point, he moved his vehicle across the street to get his headlights onto the courtyard where the disturbance was taking place.  He saw people beating on a person on the ground but could not say how many individuals were involved.  Although there was some light in the area, the darkness prevented Daniell from seeing too many details.  8Daniell saw two people walk away from the scene.  The shorter of the assailants had an undershirt or T-shirt hanging down.  They both seemed to have dark hair and dark features.  Daniell thought that the one with the longest hair was a woman.  After the police arrived at the scene, he got into his cab and drove to a library where he thought the assailants would be.  He saw them proceeding at a steady pace.  He followed them until he saw a police van and attempted to get the attention of one of the officers.  The officers then apprehended the appellants.  9Sergeant Sembo of the Calgary police was the first officer to arrive at the scene.  As he approached, he observed two individuals leaving the YWCA courtyard.  There was no one else on the street.  He radioed their description to all downtown units.  He described them as two native Canadians, one smaller than the other, the smaller possibly a female.  Sembo thought that the larger individual wore a dark black leather jacket and had long thick black hair.  10According to Sembo, the area where the victim was found was darker than the street but one could see without a flashlight.  There was light from a street light and he thought that there were also lights on in the YWCA.  11Constable Koenen, along with his partner, discovered the appellants at the library.  Their clothing appeared to be wet with blood.  Randy McMaster's clothing appeared to have more blood than that of his cousin.  Harley McMaster appeared to have blood on his hands.  He was wearing a white and black T-shirt and a black jacket.  He had long black hair, weighed approximately 180 pounds and stood about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches tall.  Randy McMaster had considerably more \"red substance\" on him.  His boots were very wet with the \"red substance\", as if he had walked through a puddle.  He was wearing a brown leather jacket with a blue denim shirt.  He had shoulder length hair and was about three inches taller than his cousin.  12The police also found at the scene a bundle of drawings bearing the names of Stimson and Randy McMaster.  (ii)The Expert Evidence  13A hair and fibre expert testified that 12 hairs from the cowboy boots worn by Randy McMaster at the time of the assault and 14 hairs from the bag in which his boots were stored were consistent with having come from the deceased. No hair was found on the running shoes worn by Harley McMaster.  A serologist testified that human blood was found on the boots, blue jeans, socks, shirt and jacket of Randy McMaster and it was consistent with the standard obtained from the deceased.  Blood found on a running shoe worn by Harley McMaster was also consistent with having come from the deceased.  14The hair and fibre expert also testified that he found 18 hairs on a piece of concrete block found at the scene and 16 hairs on another block. According to the serologist, blood consistent with that of the victim was found on these two pieces of concrete block.  (iii)The Evidence of Intoxication  15Collins testified that when he first saw the assailants crossing the street the tallest assailant took a drink out of a bottle.  Daniell testified that when the assailants left the scene, they walked with a bit of a stagger.  16Constable Koenen testified that when he arrested Harley McMaster, he was very cooperative when read his rights and appeared to understand what the officer had read to him.  He smelled of alcohol and in the opinion of the officer Harley was impaired but not intoxicated.  After his arrest, Harley McMaster fell asleep on the floor of the police interview room.  17Constable Fong testified that when he arrested Randy McMaster, he appeared to understand everything that was said to him and that he complied with the police demands.  His eyes were glassy and bloodshot and his breath smelled of alcohol.  He appeared drunk.  Constable Koenen testified that Randy McMaster also smelled of alcohol and was impaired but not intoxicated.  Another officer, Constable terKuile, assisting in the arrest, also testified that Randy McMaster appeared drunk.  Later in the police interview room Randy McMaster was asked by terKuile if he had a lawyer?  He replied that his lawyer was Karen Gainer.  Randy McMaster then sat in a chair, leaned forward and fell asleep. terKuile testified that he concluded that Randy McMaster had passed out. Another officer, Constable Comber, wrote down in his notebook that Randy McMaster had \"passed out very drunk\".  Some three hours later, Comber returned and noted that Randy McMaster was \"still very drunk\".  During the course of the early morning, the police unsuccessfully tried to wake Randy a number of times.  18Finally, when the police apprehended the appellants on the street, Randy McMaster was found carrying a gym bag as well as a wine bottle that was only half full.  The gym bag and its contents were saturated with wine.

        "Facts": " 37The appellant Norman Eugene Thibert was charged with first degree murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife's lover, Alan Sherren.  Norman Eugene Thibert married his wife, Joan Thibert, in July 1970.  The couple had two children, Michelle and Catrina, aged 22 and 19 respectively at the time of the trial.  38The Thiberts' marriage had its share of problems.  Early on in the marriage, Mr. Thibert admitted to his wife that he had had three extramarital affairs.  In September 1990, Mrs. Thibert began an intimate relationship with the deceased, a co-worker.  She disclosed this relationship to her husband in April 1991.  He was distraught and eventually convinced his wife to remain with him and attempt to make their marriage work.  39On July 2, 1991, Mrs. Thibert decided to leave her husband.  She took a hotel room rather than returning home.  The appellant drove around the city that evening, unsuccessfully searching for the hotel where his wife was staying.  When he returned home, he removed a rifle and a shotgun from the basement of the house to the garage.  He testified that he thought about killing the deceased, his wife, or himself.  He loaded the rifle, and then left the guns in a corner of the garage, having at that point abandoned his violent thoughts.  40The daughter, Catrina arrived home to find her father very upset.  He told her of her mother's affair.  At approximately 11:00 p.m., Mrs. Thibert telephoned her husband at home to tell him of her decision to leave him.  At his request, she agreed to meet him the next morning, at Smitty's Restaurant in St. Albert, a suburb of Edmonton at 7:00 a.m.  41The next morning Mr. Thibert and Catrina went to the restaurant to meet Mrs. Thibert who arrived at the meeting with the deceased.  The appellant attempted to persuade her to return home with him, but she refused.  The meeting at Smitty's lasted approximately one hour.  At the end of the meeting, Mr. Thibert promised not to bother his wife at work, and in return, she promised to think about coming home that night to again talk to him.  Outside the restaurant, while waiting for Mrs. Thibert to finish talking with Catrina, the appellant told the deceased, \"I hope you intend on moving back east or living under assumed names.... Because as long as I have got breath in my body I am not going to give up trying to get my wife back from you, and I will find you wherever you go.\" 42The appellant testified that, when he returned home, he thought about killing himself, and so returned to the garage and retrieved the guns.  He sawed off the barrel of the shotgun, but then discovered that the gun was inoperable since the firing pin was broken.  43He telephoned his wife at work several times in an effort to persuade her to return to him.  44During one afternoon call, she asked him to stop phoning her and told him that she was leaving work to make a bank deposit.  The appellant then drove into the city, planning to find his wife while she was at the bank, and away from the influence of the deceased, and again attempt to convince her to give the marriage another try.  45He put the loaded rifle in the back of his car before departing, thinking that he might have to kill the deceased.  He testified that a few miles from home he abandoned that thought, but instead planned to use the rifle as a final bluff to get his wife to come with him.  The police later seized a box of shells from the vehicle, although the appellant stated that he did not remember placing the ammunition in the car.  46At approximately 2:45 p.m., the appellant parked across the street from his wife's place of work.  When he saw Mrs. Thibert depart for the bank, he followed her.  She noticed him at a stoplight, at which time he attempted to persuade her to get into his car so they could talk.  The appellant followed Mrs. Thibert to the bank, and insisted that they go some place private to talk.  Mrs. Thibert agreed to meet him in a vacant lot but instead, out of fear returned to her workplace.  The appellant followed her into the parking lot.  The appellant again tried to persuade Mrs. Thibert to go some place with him to talk, but she continued to refuse.  47The appellant told Mrs. Thibert that he had a high powered rifle in his car, but claimed that it was not loaded.  He suggested that he would have to go into Mrs. Thibert's workplace and use the gun.  At that time, the deceased came out of the building and began to lead Mrs. Thibert back into the office.  The appellant then removed the rifle from the car.  48The appellant's evidence was that the deceased began walking towards him, with his hands on Mrs. Thibert's shoulders swinging her back and forth, saying, \"You want to shoot me?  Go ahead and shoot me.\" and \"Come on big fellow, shoot me.  You want to shoot me?  Go ahead and shoot me.\"  At some point, Mrs. Thibert either moved, or was moved aside.  The appellant testified that the deceased kept coming towards him, ignoring the appellant's instructions to stay back.  The appellant testified that his eyes were closed as he tried to retreat inward and the gun discharged.  49After the shot, Mrs. Thibert ran into the office building.  At some point, the appellant put the gun down, entered the office building, and calmly said that he wanted to talk to his wife.  He then exited the building, picked up the gun, put more ammunition in it, and said he was not going to hurt anyone.  He placed the gun in his car and drove away.  50While he was driving, the appellant noticed a police car following him.  He pulled off onto a side road, and surrendered to the police.  At the time of his arrest, Constable Baumgartner recorded that the appellant stated \"It's out of me now.  He was fooling around with my wife.\"  Constable Turner recorded the appellant's statement as \"For what it's worth, I was just after him.  For what it's worth, it's out of me now.  He was fooling around with my wife.\"  51The appellant was tried by judge and jury. He was found guilty of murder in the second degree. ",

        "Facts": " 2On the evening of October 21, 1989, the appellant Timothy Lemky and his live-in companion, Michelle Cummins, were visited at their residence by three friends, Daniel Valachy, Mike Glover and Heidi Lemky.  At about 7:45, after helping Timothy Lemky to install some wall panelling in the living room, the group began drinking from a 40 oz. bottle of Gibson’s whisky “with a drink or two\" out of it which Daniel Valachy had brought along with him.  Heidi Lemky and Mike Glover left at about 8:00 p.m.  By 9:30, the entire bottle had been consumed, mainly by Timothy Lemky and Daniel Valachy.  Shortly before ten, Timothy Lemky and Michelle Cummins left the house together and went to a local Oktoberfest dance.  An hour or so later, the couple left the dance and returned home.  Shortly before eleven o’clock, Lemky telephoned his mother, told her that Michelle Cummins was dead, and asked her to call the police.  At 11:04, he himself called the police.  He said, “My name is Randy Lemky and there has been a manslaughter here.”  Asked whether he was involved, he said, “Yes, I am. I am the one to blame.  Yes, I am.”  He told the operator that he had used a 30.30 rifle and said, “It was an accident.”  He went on to say, “I just meant to make a point.”  As the call was taking place, the police arrived at the house.  Lemky walked out the front door and said, “It’s all over.  It’s all over.  Nothing will bring her back.”  3Later, at the police station, Lemky volunteered this comment:  We were arguing, we had done this before, and I just went and got my rifle and there was a bullet in it, I didn’t think it was loaded, and it went off.  I went and tried to help her.  I couldn’t do anything for her.  After taking breathalyzer tests, the police took a further statement at 11:49, in which Lemky gave a complete account of the killing.  After describing the argument, he said:  So, we argued and we .. I had done as much as I could do, physically trying to make the point.  I reached up on the wall and I took the rifle down.  The rifle was a game, the rifle was a toy, it meant nothing.  All of a sudden, I was playing with the rifle.  My girlfriend was there, and the gun went off.  Next thing I knew, I was grasping her in my arms and the blood was, the blood was coming out .. and I was crying and I was screaming for help.  The next day at 1:07 p.m., the appellant gave a second exculpatory statement, this time explaining that the gun had been accidentally knocked to the floor and went off accidentally as he was trying to pick it up.  There was evidence that the rifle was, as a matter of course, kept loaded in the bedroom.  4The evidence on the appellant’s state of inebriation before the shooting was conflicting.  Some saw him as loud and obnoxious at the dance.  The bartender at the dance served Lemky some beer and noticed that \"he had had a few drinks before that\".  Another witness testified that the appellant showed no signs of intoxication, and seemed \"very straight\".  At 11:03, immediately after the shooting, the police noted alcohol on his breath and that his eyes were watery and bloodshot.  The breathalyzer test taken about three-quarters of an hour later showed a reading of 130 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. When asked about his consumption of alcohol that evening in the course of his initial interview with the police following the shooting, Lemky responded that he had consumed about one-half of the bottle of whisky brought by Valachy, followed by about three more drinks at the dance, and said, \"Oh, uh, I had quite a bit to drink.\" ",

        "Facts": " A.Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island and Reference re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island   11These two cases, which were heard together in these proceedings, arose out of two references which were issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of P.E.I. to the Appeal Division of the P.E.I. Supreme Court.  12The first reference,Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on October 11, 1994 by Order in Council No. EC646/94, pursuant to s. 18 of theSupreme Court Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. S-10, and came about as a result of reductions in the salaries of judges of the P.E.I. Provincial Court by thePublic Sector Pay Reduction Act, S.P.E.I. 1994, c. 51.  This statute reduced the salaries of the judges and others paid from the public purse in P.E.I. by 7.5 percent effective May 17, 1994.  The Act was part of the province’s plan to reduce its budget deficit.  Following the pay reduction, numerous accused persons challenged the constitutionality of proceedings before them in the Provincial Court, alleging that as a result of the salary reductions, the court had lost its status as an independent and impartial tribunal unders. 11(d)of theCharter.  In response to the uncertainty created by these challenges, the provincial government issued a reference to elucidate the constitutional contours of the power of the provincial legislature to decrease, increase or otherwise adjust the remuneration of judges of the Provincial Court, and to determine whether the judges of the Provincial Court still enjoyed a sufficient degree of financial security for the purposes of s. 11(d).  The Appeal Division rendered judgment on December 16, 1994: (1994), 125 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 335, 389 A.P.R. 335, 120 D.L.R. (4th) 449, 95 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 33 C.P.C. (3d) 76, [1994] P.E.I.J. No. 123 (QL).  For present purposes, it is sufficient to simply state that the court found the judges of the Provincial Court to be independent.  13The second reference,Reference re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the  Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on February 13, 1995, by Order in Council No. EC132/95, and arose out of the controversy surrounding the first reference.  Despite the Appeal Division’s decision in the first reference, accused persons continued to raise challenges based on s. 11(d) to the constitutionality of the P.E.I. Provincial Court.  In particular, Plamondon Prov. Ct. J. (formerly Chief Judge) issued a judgment in which he strongly criticized the Appeal Division’s decision, and refused to follow it:R. v. Avery, [1995] P.E.I.J. No. 42 (QL).  14The second reference was much more comprehensive in nature, and contained a series of questions concerning all three elements of the judicial independence of the P.E.I. Provincial Court: financial security (the issue in the first reference), security of tenure, and institutional (or administrative) independence.  The Appeal Division rendered judgment on May 4, 1995, and answered most of the questions to the effect that the Provincial Court was independent and impartial: (1995), 130 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 29, 405 A.P.R. 29, 124 D.L.R. (4th) 528, 39 C.P.C. (3d) 241, [1995] P.E.I.J. No. 66 (QL).  The appellants (who are the same appellants as in the first reference) appeal from this holding.  However, the court did hold that Provincial Court judges lacked a sufficient degree of security of tenure to meet the standard set bys. 11(d)of theCharter.  The respondent Crown cross-appeals from this aspect of the judgment.  15Because of their length and complexity, I have chosen to append the questions put in the two P.E.I. references as Appendices “A” and “B”.  B.R. v. Campbell, R. v. Ekmecic and R. v. Wickman  16This appeal arises out of three separate and unrelated criminal proceedings commenced against the respondents Shawn Carl Campbell, Ivica Ekmecic, and Percy Dwight Wickman in the province of Alberta.  Campbell was charged with unlawful possession of a prohibited weapon, contrary tos. 90(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, and subsequently, in connection with the charge of unlawful possession, with failing to attend court in contravention ofs. 145(5)of theCriminal Code.   Wickman was charged with two different offences — operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate that vehicle was impaired by alcohol, in violation ofs. 253(a) of theCriminal Code, and operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams, in contravention ofs. 253(b) of theCriminal Code.  Ekmecic was charged with unlawful assault contrary tos. 266of theCriminal Code.  17The three respondents pled not guilty, and the Crown elected to proceed summarily in all three cases.  The accused appeared, in separate proceedings, before the Alberta Provincial Court.  At various points in their trials, they each brought a motion before the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, arguing that the Provincial Court was not an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of s. 11(d).  The trials for Campbell and Ekmecic were both adjourned before they commenced.  Wickman, by contrast, moved for and was granted an adjournment after the Crown had completed its case and six witnesses had testified for the defence, including the accused.  Amongst the three of them, the respondents sought orders in the nature of prohibition,certiorari, declarations, and stays.  18The allegations of unconstitutionality,inter alia, dealt with a 5 percent  reduction in the salaries of judges of the Provincial Court brought about by thePayment to Provincial Judges Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 116/94, and s. 17(1) of theProvincial Court Judges Act, S.A. 1981, c. P-20.1, which is the statutory basis for the aforementioned regulation.  The 5 percent reduction was accomplished by a 3.1 percent direct salary reduction, and by 5 unpaid days leave of absence.  The respondents also attacked the constitutionality of changes to the judges’ pension plan by theProvincial Judges and Masters in Chambers Pension Plan Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 29/92, and theManagement Employees Pension Plan, Alta. Reg. 367/93, which respectively had the effect of reducing the base salary for calculating pension benefits, and limiting cost of living increases to 60 percent of the Consumer Price Index.  In addition, the respondents challenged the constitutionality of the power of the Attorney General to designate the court’s sitting days and judges’ place of residence.  McDonald J., on the motions, also put at issue the process for disciplining Provincial Court judges and the grounds for removal of judges of the Provincial Court.  19Finally, and in large part, the constitutional challenges seem to have been precipitated by the remarks of Premier Ralph Klein during a radio interview.  Mr. Klein stated that a judge of the provincial youth court, who had indicated that he would not sit in protest over his salary reduction, should be “very, very quickly fired”.  20All three motions were heard by McDonald J., who found that the Alberta Provincial Court was no longer independent: (1994), 160 A.R. 81, 25 Alta. L.R. (3d) 158, [1995] 2 W.W.R. 469, [1994] A.J. No. 866 (QL).  However, he obviated the need for a stay by issuing a declaration that provincial legislation and regulations which were the source of the s. 11(d) violation were of no force or effect.  As a result, although the Crown lost on the constitutional issue, it won on the issue of the stay.  The Crown appealed to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeals, and therefore did not consider the merits of the arguments: (1995), 169 A.R. 178, 97 W.A.C. 178, 31 Alta. L.R. (3d) 190, 100 C.C.C. (3d) 167, [1995] 8 W.W.R. 747, [1995] A.J. No. 610 (QL).  The Crown now appeals to this Court, both on the question of the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction and the merits of the constitutional issue.  I stated constitutional questions on June 26, 1996.  These questions can be found in Appendix “C”.  C.Manitoba Provincial Judges Assn. v. Manitoba (Minister of Justice)  21This appeal deals with reductions to the salaries of judges of the Manitoba Provincial Court, byThe Public Sector Reduced Work Week and Compensation Management Act, S.M. 1993, c. 21, otherwise known as “Bill 22”.  Bill 22 led to the reduction of the salaries of a large number of public sector employees, including employees of Crown corporations, hospitals, personal care homes, child and family services agencies, municipalities, school boards, universities and colleges.  The legislation was passed as part of a plan to reduce the province’s deficit.  Bill 22 provided for different treatment of the several classes of employees to which it applied.  It provided that public sector employers “may” require employees to take unpaid days of leave.  However, judges of the Provincial Court, along with persons who received remuneration as members of a Crown agency or a board, commission or committee to which they were appointed by the government, received a mandatory reduction of 3.8 percent in the 1993-94 fiscal year.  For the next fiscal year, Bill 22 provided that judges’ salaries were to be reduced  by an amount that is generally equivalent to the amount by which the wages of employees under a collective agreement with Her Majesty in right of Manitoba are reduced in the same period as a result of a requirement to take days or portions of days of leave without pay in that period.

        "Facts": " 7On March 2, 1993, the respondent A.B. was arrested and charged that, between February 15, 1980, and December 31, 1980, in Sault Ste. Marie, he indecently assaulted the appellant L.L.A., then six years of age, contrary to s. 140 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (nowR.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, s. 151).  8L.L.A. sought counselling at both appellant counselling institutions.  The appellant Sexual Assault Care Centre of the Plummer Memorial Public Hospital is a division of the public hospital at which L.L.A. attended for counselling in January, 1992.  The appellant Women in Crisis (Algoma) Inc., operating as \"Women's Outreach\", is a partially publicly funded organization where L.L.A. sought counselling in November, 1992.  It provides counselling to adult women who are victims/survivors of sexual abuse, sexual assault, family violence and other types of violence against women.  9At the preliminary inquiry on June 2, 1993, the respondent was committed to stand trial.  The trial was scheduled to start on February 14, 1994.  On February 3, 1994, the respondent served subpoenasduces tecumon the appellants Sexual Assault Care Centre and Women's Outreach, commanding them to bring to court, on February 14, 1994, all records relating to the proceedings and to the appellant L.L.A.  At the same time, the respondent served the appellants Sexual Assault Care Centre and Women's Outreach as well as the Crown with a notice of motion for an order that the appellants Sexual Assault Care Centre and Women's Outreach produce to the defence, before the scheduled trial date, all records relating to the appellant L.L.A.  The motion came before Whalen J. on February 9, 1994, and was adjourned to be dealt with by the trial judge on February 14.  On February 10, 1994, the Crown served and filed a notice of application for an order quashing the subpoenas.  10On February 14, 1994, Loukidelis J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division, heard both applications separately.  He dealt first with the application from the Crown to quash the subpoenas, which he dismissed, concluding that \"there may be information at hand that is relevant to the issue\".  Loukidelis J. then heard the motion from the respondent for production of the records.  He held:  In view of the way that these matters were brought before me, the issue is not whether this is a fishing expedition because that is an issue of a bona fide need for the evidence which was subsumed under the question of relevance.  This argument advances the issue of privilege.  Loukidelis J. observed that there was no statutory basis for the claim of privilege and that the traditional classes of privilege created by the common law, such as the solicitor-client privilege, were not applicable.  He concluded that the records were not privileged and ordered that all records sought be produced to the respondent, subject to the condition that no copies be made.  He then granted an adjournment to allow the parties to assess their respective positions.  Given the appellants' intention to appeal the order for production, Loukidelis J. ordered a stay of his order until the appeals were disposed of.  The appellants filed notices of appeal on March 17, 1994, at which time the respondent brought applications to quash the appeals.  11On January 6, 1995, the Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction in a unanimous decision (A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.)(1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 170).  Relying upon the decision of this Court inDagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was no provision under theCodeallowing for interlocutory appeals either for parties or third parties from rulings at trial relating to the admissibility of evidence or documents.  As such, it held that the appellants had no right to appeal to the Court of Appeal until there had been a final verdict at trial.  As a result, the Court of Appeal ordered the production of the documents and directed that the trial before Loukidelis J. proceed.  12Pursuant tos. 40(1)of theSupreme Court Act, the appellants applied for leave to appeal to this Court from Loukidelis J.'s order for the production of the documents.  They also applied for a stay of the trial pending this Court's decision on their appeal.   The trial date was set for June 5, 1995.  On March 17, 1995, this Court remitted the question of the stay to the trial judge and, on March 27, the application for leave to appeal was granted: [1995] 1 S.C.R. viii.

        "Facts": " 44While the appellant was not subjected to a body “cavity” search, the search conducted went far beyond the typical “frisk” search which usually accompanies an arrest.  Sergeant Kennedy passed his gloved hand through the appellant’s hair to remove some hair, combed some more out, and clipped and pulled out still more.  The appellant was then made to pull hair from his own pubic area.  A dentist was called in to take the appellant’s teeth impressions and buccal swabs.  All this was without the appellant’s consent and despite his protests.  The dental procedure involved the placing of several instruments and various substances into the appellant’s mouth.  As well, photographs and a video were taken of his mouth.  The whole procedure took two hours.  45Counsel for the respondent argued that the taking of dental impressions was analogous to the routine practice of fingerprinting.  The case ofR. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, was cited as support for the proposition that the common law allowed for the use of such identification procedures upon arrest.  In that case, La Forest J. noted that the reduced privacy expectation upon arrest justifies the fingerprinting.  However, he added this important qualification at p. 413:  While some may find [fingerprinting] distasteful, it is insubstantial, of very short duration, and leaves no lasting impression.  There is no penetration into the body and no substance is removed from it.  46How very different is the making of dental impressions.  It is a lengthy and highly intrusive process.  Further, the taking of the scalp and pubic hair samples involved the forceful removal of hair from the body over the specific objections of the accused.  Significantly, inR. v. Borden, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, it was found that where there is no statutory authorization for the seizure of bodily samples, consent must be obtained if the seizure is to be lawful.  Here the police knew they were dealing with a young offender. They were aware that theYoung Offenders Actrequired that a parent or counsel should be present when a suspected young offender was being interviewed.  Nonetheless, in the absence of any adult counsellor and contrary to the specific instruction of his lawyers, the police interviewed the appellant at length and by threat of force took bodily samples and dental impressions.  This was the abusive exercise of raw physical authority by the police.  47No matter what may be the pressing temptations to obtain evidence from a person the police believe to be guilty of a terrible crime, and no matter what the past frustrations to their investigations, the police authority to search as an incident to arrest should not be exceeded.  Any other conclusion could all too easily lead to police abuses in the name of the good of society as perceived by the officers.  When they are carrying out their duties as highly respected and admired agents of the state they must respect the dignity and bodily integrity of all who are arrested.  The treatment meted out by agents of the state to even the least deserving individual will often indicate the treatment that all citizens of the state may ultimately expect.  Appropriate limits to the power of search incidental to arrest must be accepted and respected.  48The power to search and seize incidental to arrest was a pragmatic extension to the power of arrest.  Obviously the police must be able to protect themselves from attack by the accused who has weapons concealed on his person or close at hand.  The police must be able to collect and preserve evidence located at the site of the arrest or in a nearby motor vehicle.  As Rice J.A. put it in his dissenting reasons (at p. 360 N.B.R.):  The power to search and seize incidental to an arrest is predicated on pragmatic and exigent considerations inherent to the circumstances of an arrest.  49The common law power cannot be so broad as to empower police officers to seize bodily samples.  They are usually in no danger of disappearing.  Here, there was no likelihood that the appellant’s teeth impressions would change, nor that his hair follicles would present a different DNA profile with the passage of time.  There was simply no possibility of the evidence sought being destroyed if it was not seized immediately.  It should be remembered that one of the limitations to the common law power articulated inCloutier v. Langlois,supra, was the discretionary aspect of the power and that it should not be abusive.  The common law power of search incidental to arrest cannot be so broad as to encompass the seizure without valid statutory authority of bodily samples in the face of a refusal to provide them.  If it is, then the common law rule itself is unreasonable, since it is too broad and fails to properly balance the competing rights involved.  50It is clear that the appellant’s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was very seriously violated.  Since the search and seizure of the bodily samples was not authorized by either statutory or common law it could not have been reasonable. It is thus unnecessary to consider either the reasonableness of the law or the manner in which the search was conducted.  (b)Did the Taking of the Hair Samples, Teeth Impressions and Buccal Swabs Contravene Section 7 of theCharter?  51The taking of the dental impressions, hair samples and buccal swabs from the accused also contravened the appellant’ss. 7Charterright to security of the person.  The taking of the bodily samples was highly intrusive.  It violated the sanctity of the body which is essential to the maintenance of human dignity.  It was the ultimate invasion of the appellant’s privacy.  SeePohoretsky,supra.  InDyment,supra, at pp. 431‑32, La Forest J. emphasized that “the use of a person’s body without his consent to obtain information about him, invades an area of personal privacy essential to the maintenance of his human dignity”.  Quite simply, the taking of the samples without authorization violated the appellant’s right to security of his person and contravened the principles of fundamental justice.

        "Facts": " 6.                       On Saturday, June 8, 1991, at around 8:20 a.m., the body of Frank Boyle, aged 85 years, was found at his home on Cedar Creek Road in Likely, British Columbia.  He had died following a fierce attack involving five blows to the head, each of sufficient force to kill him, with an iron bar or similar object.  While the exact time of death could not be ascertained, he was last seen alive the previous evening.  The officer in charge of the investigation noted that blood was spattered everywhere at the Boyle residence, and noted also Sportsman brand cigarettes at the scene.  7.                       As a result of information provided by several bystanders, the three investigating officers went to the scene of a motor vehicle accident, which involved the deceased’s red Datsun pickup truck, about half a kilometre west of the Boyle residence.  Two local residents, Kelly Spurn and Cindy Potter, offered new information to the police.  Cindy Potter told the police that she had seen Boyle’s truck in the ditch at 6:45 that morning.  Furthermore, she stated that she had seen someone she identified as Michael walking in an easterly direction along Cedar Creek Road a few minutes earlier with a beer or a coffee cup in his hand.  The officer in charge testified that Kelly Spurn told him that the appellant was living on Spurn’s property which he was renting out to the appellant’s sister, Angela Feeney, and her spouse equivalent, Dale Russell.  Spurn suggested that the police go and speak to Russell.  Spurn testified that he had told the police that he assumed it was the appellant who had crashed the pickup truck because the skid marks and the location of the accident were in the same place as skid marks from another accident earlier that morning which had involved the appellant and a blue flatbed truck.  8.                       Upon arrival at the Spurn property where Dale Russell, Angela Feeney and the appellant were living, Russell told police that the appellant had stolen a truck from the Spurn property earlier that morning and that he found it just down from Boyle’s residence, exactly where Boyle’s truck was found later.  He also said that the appellant had come home at 7:00 a.m. after a night of drinking and was now asleep in the trailer behind his residence.  9.                       The officer in charge went to the windowless trailer and knocked on the door and said, “Police”.  Receiving no answer, he entered the trailer with his gun drawn and pointing downward, went to the appellant’s bed, shook the appellant’s leg and said “I want to talk to you.”   The officer then asked the appellant to get out of bed and move into the better light at the front of the trailer.  The officer stated in evidence that he did so in order to inspect the appellant’s clothes for  bloodstains.  The officer conceded that he may have touched the appellant in leading him to the  door.   The officer noticed blood spattered all over the front of the appellant and had another officer read the appellant his rights in these terms ((1995), 54 B.C.A.C. 228, at p. 230):  It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You may call any lawyer you want. A Legal Aid duty lawyer is available to provide legal advice to you without charge and can explain the Legal Aid plan to you.  If you wish to contact a Legal Aid duty lawyer, I can provide you with a telephone number. Do you understand?...You are not obliged to say anything but anything you do say may be given in evidence.   10.                     The appellant was arrested and asked whether he understood his rights.  He did not respond at first, but when asked again he stated (at p. 230), “Of course, do you think I am illiterate?” or words  to that effect.   The officer in charge immediately asked the appellant how he got blood on himself, to which the appellant replied that he had been hit in the face with a baseball the day before.  When asked whether a particular pair of shoes were the shoes he had worn the previous evening, the appellant replied that they were the only shoes he owned.  There was also some discussion with him about a package of Sportsman cigarettes observed in the trailer.  11.                     The appellant was led to the police vehicle where the tee shirt he was wearing was seized.  He was taken to the Williams Lake RCMP detachment.   At around 12:00 noon the appellant tried unsuccessfully several times to contact a lawyer.  At 12:17 p.m. he  left a message for the lawyer to call back.  At 12:23 p.m. a breathalyzer sample was taken from the appellant, who was not told that he had a choice in the matter.  The appellant was kept in an observation cell for over eight hours.  At 9:10 p.m. two detectives began questioning the appellant.  The appellant stated, at p. 231, “I should have a lawyer”, but the interview continued.  The appellant admitted to striking Boyle, stealing cigarettes, beer, and cash from  Boyle’s residence and stated that he had put the cash under his mattress in his trailer.  The police then obtained a search warrant authorizing them to seize the shoes, the Sportsman cigarettes, and the money under the mattress.  The appellant was interviewed again for approximately 1 1/2 hours at 3:05 a.m. on June 9.  The appellant had still not seen a lawyer.  On  Monday, June 10, at 9:25 a.m., and again at 10:54 a.m., the accused was fingerprinted.  In between these fingerprinting sessions the appellant met with a lawyer for the first time since he had been arrested.  12.                     The appellant was ultimately convicted of second degree murder following a jury trial in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed his appeal.

        "Facts": " 3The appellants D.R. and H.R. are the natural parents of the complainants, Michael R., who was born in 1979, and Michelle R. and Kathleen (Kathy) R., twins who were born in 1982.  The appellant D.W. is the boyfriend of H.R., now divorced from D.R.  All the appellants are deaf; only D.W. is able to speak.  4The appellants were jointly charged with several counts of sexual assault and gross indecency, and one count of assault, arising out of alleged incidents involving the children between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1989.  In this time period the children ranged in age from one to ten.  D.R. and H.R. were also charged with incest and several additional counts of assault causing bodily harm.  5D.R. and H.R. were married in 1979 when she was 21 and he was 48.  She had a drinking problem, and their relationship was unstable.  The couple had difficulty raising their children.  The Department of Social Welfare was involved as early as 1983, when the twins were hospitalized because of malnutrition.  By 1986, H.R. was spending most of her time away from the home, and began a relationship with D.W.  As a result, primary care for the children fell on D.R.  His failure to adequately take care of the children led to their placement in the K. foster home in February 1987.  At that time, Michael was seven years old and the twins were five.  The children had frequent unsupervised visits with D.R. until September 1987.  They had only sporadic, supervised visits with H.R. and D.W.  6All three children were observed by Mr. and Mrs. K. to be hyperactive and difficult to control.  They appeared to be sexually overt, and were often found kissing and hugging, or naked together in the playroom.  Mrs. Garnet Francis taught Michael from September 1986 to the spring of 1989 in a special class for problem children, and noted his aggressive sexual behaviour that included inappropriate touching of other children, undressing, and inviting other children and staff to have sex with him.  Similar observations were made of the twins who later attended the same school.  7In September 1987, the children visited D.R.'s residence for an overnight stay.  When they returned to the K. home, Mrs. K. noticed blood stains on Michelle's underwear.  When she asked Michelle what had happened, Michelle said that her daddy had “touched” her.  The next day, Mrs. K. took Michelle to Dr. McKenna for a physical examination.  Dr. McKenna concluded that Michelle had been subjected to non-accidental trauma of the genital area.  Michelle told the doctor that \"my deaf daddy spanked my bum then he put his fingers in my bum, it hurt\".  At trial, Michelle was unable to recall anything about the incident.  8By December 12, 1989, Michael's behaviour had deteriorated so badly that the K. family was unable to continue taking care of him.  He was removed from the K. home and placed in the foster care of Mr. and Mrs. T.  Some time after his arrival at the T. residence, Michael made allegations that he and his sisters had been sexually abused by the K. family.  As a result, the twins were removed to the T. residence on May 29, 1990.  On June 5, 1990, all three children were examined by Dr. Yelland who found some medical evidence consistent with sexual abuse.  9Subsequently, the children began making multiple allegations of sexual abuse against their birth parents, D.W., the K. family and many K. family relatives.  In addition, the children claimed that while in the care of their birth parents, they had been witness or party to the killing and eating of babies, as well as the eating and drinking of faeces, blood and urine.  At that time, the children began treatment with Ms. Carol Bunko-Ruys, a child therapist.  10Sergeant Dueck, a Saskatoon police officer assigned to investigate the allegations, interviewed the children at length in videotaped sessions.  The therapist was present at interviews conducted during October and November of 1990.  11Dr. Yelland reexamined the children on May 31, 1991, and found further evidence of injuries that he believed was consistent with the types of physical and sexual abuse alleged by the children.  12Based upon the medical evidence and police investigation, the appellants were charged with sexually and physically abusing the children.  Mr. and Mrs. K., and several members of their family, including Mr. K.'s father, Peter K., were separately charged with offences arising out of the alleged sexual assault of the children.  After the trial of the appellants, Peter K., who had earlier been convicted of an unrelated sexual assault on two neighbourhood girls, pled guilty to charges of sexual assault against the R. children.  The remaining charges against the K. family were either withdrawn or stayed.  13The appellants were tried by Batten J., sitting without a jury.  At the trial, which lasted 22 days, all three children testified under oath.  The accused D.R. also gave evidence.  D.R. was convicted of three counts of sexual assault and two counts of assault causing bodily harm, and acquitted of two counts of incest, two counts of assault and three counts of gross indecency.  14H.R. was convicted of three counts of sexual assault and two counts of assault causing bodily harm, and was acquitted of one count of incest, four counts of assault and three counts of gross indecency.  15D.W. was convicted of three counts of sexual assault, and acquitted of two counts of gross indecency and one count of assault.  16All the convictions were appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which, by majority, dismissed the appeals: (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 353, 131 Sask. R. 81, 95 W.A.C. 81.  Vancise J.A. dissented.  The appellants bring this appeal as of right based on the dissent. ",

C-46.  The first offence occurred in 1986 when the appellant was 29 years of age.  The complainant was then a 16-year-old ward of the Alberta government and had been placed in the appellant's home by Social Services.  Approximately two weeks after her arrival in the appellant's home, the complainant was asleep on the living room couch, lying on her back.  The appellant came home intoxicated.  He undid the complainant’s pants, at which point the complainant turned over on her stomach and tried to press herself into the couch.  She testified that she did so in the hope that perhaps he would go away if he thought she were sleeping.  He did not.  Instead, he took off her jeans and started to kiss her buttock area.  She was trying to pretend that she was sleeping.  Then he penetrated her vagina with his penis.  She described the degree of penetration as being \"a little bit\" since she had her legs pressed together and he was trying to get them apart.  Finally, he said \"You're too difficult\" and rolled onto the floor.  He tried to put the complainant's jeans back on.  The complainant waited until she was sure that the appellant was asleep on the floor and then she went downstairs to her room.  At no time did the complainant consent to the appellant's actions.  4The second offence occurred in 1993 when the appellant was 36 years of age.  The complainant was a 14-year-old babysitter for the appellant's family.  She had fallen asleep on her stomach on a hide-a-bed while babysitting.  She testified that when she had gone to bed, she had been wearing a T-shirt, underwear and had a sleeping bag wrapped around her.  When she awoke at 3:30 a.m., her underwear was pulled down and the sleeping bag was around her feet.  The appellant was on top of her, rubbing her back under her T-shirt with one hand and rubbing her buttocks with the other.  He then reached under her stomach touching her pelvis and vaginal areas.  The appellant was trying to turn her over onto her stomach.  He did not touch her breasts.  She screamed and fled from the residence.  5The appellant pleaded guilty to the two offences.  The sentencing judge found that neither of the two sexual assaults was a major one. She imposed a sentence of 12 months in custody followed by two years’ probation.  The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, finding that the sexual assaults were major ones and sentenced the appellant to five years’ imprisonment: (1995), 169 A.R. 170, 97 W.A.C. 170.  The appellant appeals the Court of Appeal’s decision.

        "Facts": " 3The appellant, Mr. Latimer, was the father of Tracy Latimer, a severely disabled child who died at her family farm on Sunday, October 24, 1993.  Tracy suffered from extreme cerebral palsy and was quadriplegic.  As a result of her physical condition,  she was largely immobile and bedridden, and was physically unable to take care of herself.  Her family provided her with constant care.  Eating was a difficult task, and Tracy had to be spoon fed.  Unfortunately, even with this assistance, she could not consume a sufficient amount of nutrients, and as a result experienced weight loss.  4It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain.  The evidence traces this pain to an operation  that Tracy underwent in 1990 to balance the muscles around her pelvis, and another operation in 1992 to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back. Although the latter surgery was successful, it led to the dislocation of her right hip, which caused considerable discomfort.  As well, despite the administration of medication, Tracy experienced five to six seizures every day.  5Tracy was in the care of Mr. Latimer when she passed away.  The appellant had remained home to care for Tracy, while Tracy’s mother and siblings were at church to attend a Sunday service.  Tracy was found by Mrs. Latimer at approximately 1:30 p.m., when she went to get Tracy for lunch.  At 2:00 p.m., Mr. Latimer advised the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP by telephone that Tracy had passed away in her sleep.  The RCMP officer who took the call and the local coroner attended at the Latimer farm.  While at the farm, the coroner examined Tracy’s body in order to determine the cause of death.  Finding no evidence to suggest suffocation, the coroner arranged for an autopsy.  During the visit to the farm, Mr. Latimer maintained that Tracy had passed away in her sleep.  He stated that Tracy had been in pain and put to bed at about 12:30 p.m.  6The autopsy found no signs that would explain Tracy’s death, but found signs consistent with poisoning.  Samples of Tracy’s blood were therefore sent to a forensic laboratory for further analysis.  Tests indicated that Tracy’s blood was saturated with carbon monoxide.  Because of the high levels of carbon monoxide in Tracy’s blood, the RCMP began to treat the matter as a homicide investigation.  7The members of the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP inferred the possibility of motive and opportunity from the facts before them — the appellant was alone with Tracy at the time of her death, and Tracy was bedridden and in constant pain.  They then decided to seek the assistance of the General Investigation Section at North Battleford, representatives of which they met with on Wednesday, November 3, 1993.  As a result of that meeting, members of the North Battleford detachment decided to attend at the Latimer farm, take Mr. Latimer into custody, interview his wife and execute a search warrant.  8This plan was put into effect the next day, on Thursday, November 4, 1993.  The events are described in the uncontradicted testimony of one of the principal investigators, Corporal Lyons, which is quoted in the trial judgment.  Important portions of that testimony, which are central to the disposition of this appeal, are underlined for emphasis:  At 8:28 that morning, Sergeant Conlon and I went to the residence.  . . .  We went to the door, we rapped on it, waited a couple of minutes.  Robert Latimer came to the door.  He was — appeared to have just been in the process of getting up, he was in a housecoat, hair messed a little bit.  Sergeant Conlon introduced ourselves to him, identified us, of course.  We shook hands.  Sergeant Conlon told him that we were from North Battleford and were assisting Wilkie in the investigation of Tracy’s death, being his daughter, and told Mr. Latimer that we’d like to speak to him.  He went into a bedroom and got dressed, came out a couple of minutes later.  We were waiting in the kitchen.  Sergeant Conlon said that we’d like to speak to him outside.  There was no response.  He put on his -- put on his rubber boots and a jacket and went outside to the car with us.  We had an unmarked police vehicle . . . I went into the driver’s seat, Sergeant Conlon the passenger side, and Mr. Latimer in the back seat behind me.  . . . ",

        "Facts": " 2Michael Dawson was born on January 31, 1983, to Judith Seymour and the appellant.  The appellant was physically abusive towards Seymour, and the couple were separated just before Michael’s third birthday.  Later that year, the appellant underwent a religious conversion and took up residence in a religious community at Clark’s Harbour, Nova Scotia.  Although Michael originally remained with his mother, she became unable to care for him, and, in December 1986, Seymour agreed that Michael should live with the appellant.  It was also agreed that the appellant would be solely responsible for Michael’s upbringing.  In August 1987, the appellant and Michael moved to an affiliated religious community located on the Myrtle Tree Farm at Waterville, Nova Scotia.  3Near the end of 1987, Michael was taken from his father by provincial officials acting under an order of the Family Court of Nova Scotia, on the ground that he was a “child in need of protection” within the meaning of theChildren’s Services Act, S.N.S. 1976, c. 8.  Lengthy court proceedings ensued, at the conclusion of which the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that the Family Court’s order wasultra viresand ordered that Michael be returned to his father.  4Over the next few years, Seymour became dissatisfied with the limitations which the appellant was placing on her access to Michael, and, in 1992, she applied to the Family Court for custody and access.  Pending the resolution of the matter, the Family Court orderedex partethat Seymour be granted “interim liberal access” and that Michael not be removed from Nova Scotia.  5Soon after being served with the interim order, the appellant vanished, taking Michael with him.  He sent a letter to the Chief Judge of the Family Court, explaining that he was motivated purely by a desire to protect Michael’s interests.  6Seymour heard nothing from the appellant or their son until two years later, when the appellant was arrested.  At the time of his arrest, the appellant was living with Michael in California under an assumed name.  The appellant and Michael were returned to Nova Scotia, where the appellant was charged with having disobeyed a court order contrary tos. 127(1)of theCriminal Codeand with having “taken” Michael contrary to s. 283(1)(a) of theCode.  Throughout the relevant period, the latter provision read as follows: ",

        "Facts": " 98There must be a reasoned basis, grounded in the facts of the case and the way the trial has unfolded and will unfold, for concluding that the accused’s right to make full answer and defence will probably be prejudiced by receiving the new evidence.  The prejudice must be specific and identifiable.  The judge may be expected to address issues like the following.  If the evidence had been introduced earlier, what would the defence have done differently and how would that have affected the outcome?  Has the defence lost opportunities to develop evidence which might well have undermined the late evidence?  Is the potential prejudice capable of being corrected by permitting the defence time to cross-examine the witness, produce rebutting evidence, or recall witnesses who have earlier testified?  99“Prejudice”, for the purposes of this inquiry, is used in the legal, procedural sense.  The fact that the evidence tendered may be powerful evidence for the prosecution does not lead to a conclusion of prejudice.  The inquiry into prejudice focuses not on the effect the evidence may have on the outcome of the trial, but on its effect on the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  The question is not whether the evidence may tend to convict the accused, but whether it is likely to convict him unjustly.  The just or fair trial is one which gets at the truth, while respecting the fundamental right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  100Nor does the inquiry into prejudice assume that the accused has a right to a trial conducted in accordance with a particular procedure.  Rules of procedure are important aids to ensuring that trials are conducted fairly and accused persons are accorded the right to make full answer and defence.  But they are not ends in themselves.  They are the servants of justice, not its masters.  Inevitably circumstances arise which make it  necessary to deviate from this rule or that.  The law permits this, provided that when the entire trial is viewed as a whole, it cannot be said that injustice has resulted or that an accused has been denied his right to make full answer and defence.  TheCharterguarantees the accused a fundamentally fair trial, not a perfect trial:R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 362perLa Forest J.;R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at p. 587perMcLachlin J..  101Finally, in exercising his or her discretion to admit late evidence, the judge must not overlook the importance of providing the trier of fact with the evidence it needs to resolve the issues before it.  As Cory J. put it inAalders,supra,“the rules should not go so far as to deprive the trier of fact of important evidence, that can be helpful to resolving an essential element of the case” (pp. 498-99).  Although the emphasis is on the protection of the accused during the third stage of the trial (P. (M.B.),supra, at p. 570), society’s interest in the efficient administration of justice is still a valid consideration.  The judge must consider both in deciding whether to admit evidence which appears for the first time late in the trial.  The more serious the prejudice to the accused in allowing the evidence to be admitted, the less important are society’s interests.  102In summary, the approach of presumptive or inferred prejudice suggested by Cory J. in this case is inconsistent with the approach taken by the English courts in cases likeMcKennaand this Court in cases likeRobillardandAalders,supra.  The jurisprudence suggests that a trial judge has a discretion to receive unforeseen evidence late in the trial provided the accused’s right to make full answer and defence is not thereby prejudiced, and that absent apparent injustice, a court of appeal should not interfere with the exercise of this discretion.  The same jurisprudence suggests that the inquiry before the trial judge is founded in the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that there is no presumption or automatic inference of prejudice.  The question is whether in the particular circumstances of the case, actual prejudice to the right to make full answer and defence is likely to result.  This approach protects both our system of justice and the accused’sCharterrights.

        "Facts": " 3Arye Dynar, a Canadian citizen, was the subject of a failed “sting” operation attempted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. Mr. Dynar was indicted together with Maurice Cohen, who is also a Canadian citizen, in the United States District Court of Nevada. The United States indictment charged both Mr. Dynar and Mr. Cohen with one count of attempting to launder money in violation of Title 18,United States Code, § 1956(a)(3), and one count of conspiracy to violate Title 18,United States Code, § 1956(a)(3), contrary to Title 18,United States Code, § 371. The Government of the United States requested their extradition by Diplomatic Note dated November 30, 1992. This appeal relates to the request for the extradition of Mr. Dynar.  4The events that formed the basis of the indictment began with a telephone call placed on January 2, 1990, from Canada, by Mr. Dynar to a former associate, Lucky Simone, who was living in Nevada.  The call was apparently made to seek investors for a business operation in the United States.  Lucky Simone had, unbeknownst to Mr. Dynar, become a confidential informant working for FBI agent William Matthews.  He informed Agent Matthews of Mr. Dynar’s call, and Agent Matthews requested that Mr. Simone return the call.  Mr. Simone gave his consent for Agent Matthews to record the conversation.  5Affidavit evidence filed by the Requesting State indicates that, during the 1980s, Mr. Dynar was the subject of investigations in the United States pertaining to the laundering of substantial amounts of money originating in the State of Nevada.  Agent Matthews’ involvement in the investigation of Mr. Dynar’s activities began in 1988.  When Mr. Dynar made contact with Lucky Simone in 1990, Agent Matthews deposed that he decided to determine whether or not Mr. Dynar was still involved in laundering money which was the proceeds of crime.  He had Mr. Simone introduce a second confidential informant, known as “Anthony”, to Mr. Dynar.  Anthony was instructed to ask if Mr. Dynar would be willing to launder large sums obtained as a result of illegal trafficking.  When asked, Mr. Dynar agreed with alacrity to launder money for Anthony.  6A great many conversations between the two men were recorded over the course of some months.  On all of these occasions, Anthony was in Las Vegas, Nevada and Mr. Dynar was in Canada.  Eventually, Mr. Dynar and Anthony arranged an initial meeting.  The meeting was purportedly to allow Anthony to give money to Mr. Dynar for laundering as a first step towards developing a relationship in which Mr. Dynar would regularly launder money for him.  During several of the conversations, it was made clear that the money to be laundered was “drug money”.  Mr. Dynar insisted more than once that the amounts had to be large in order to make his efforts worthwhile.  The conversations also disclosed that Mr. Dynar had an associate named “Moe”, who was subsequently identified as Maurice Cohen.  Agent Matthews recorded all of the conversations in Las Vegas pursuant to the applicable law of the United States, which only requires the consent of one party for the lawful interception of the conversation.  Special Agent Charles Pine of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was able to identify the voice of Maurice Cohen in the background of several of the conversations.  7The initial plan of the American authorities was to set up the transfer of funds to Mr. Dynar in the United States.  However, Mr. Dynar believed that he was the subject of a sealed indictment in the United States charging him with laundering very large sums of money and that if he travelled to that country, he would be arrested.  It was accordingly agreed that Mr. Dynar’s associate, Maurice Cohen, would meet Anthony’s associate in Buffalo.  Mr. Cohen was to take the money to Toronto where it would be laundered by Mr. Dynar.  It would then be taken back to Buffalo by Mr. Cohen on the following day, after a commission for Mr. Dynar had been deducted.  8In Buffalo, Mr. Cohen met with Special Agent Dennis McCarthy of the IRS, who was posing as Anthony’s associate.  The conversations that took place between them in preparation for the transfer of funds were recorded by Agent McCarthy.  They contain several statements to the effect that Mr. Cohen was working for Mr. Dynar, as well as some explanations of the logistics of the laundering scheme.  In the end, however, the money was not transferred to Mr. Cohen.  The FBI aborted the operation by pretending to arrest Agent McCarthy just prior to the transfer of the money.  Mr. Cohen was allowed to return to Canada.  9A committal hearing under s. 13 of theExtradition Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E‑23, was held before Keenan J. of the Ontario Court (General Division).  In support of the request for extradition of Mr. Dynar and Mr. Cohen, the United States as the Requesting State relied upon affidavits from the investigating officers and transcripts of the recorded telephone conversations.  This evidence formed the basis for the decision to commit Mr. Dynar for extradition.  10Keenan J. proceeded on the assumption that there was no involvement by Canadian authorities in the investigation and he was therefore highly critical of the conduct of the United States authorities in carrying out the investigation.  It subsequently became clear that the Canadian authorities had indeed been consulted and informed regarding the various stages of the investigation.  A memo from a U.S. federal government lawyer received by the Canadian Department of Justice in response to Keenan J.’s decision indicated that a formal cooperative arrangement was in place in which information was exchanged between United States and Canadian authorities regarding Mr. Dynar’s activities.  11Mr. Dynar’s counsel complained of the lack of disclosure of the Canadian involvement in the investigation to the Minister of Justice in written submissions that were made prior to the Minister’s decision to surrender Mr. Dynar.  Mr. Dynar’s counsel also attempted on two occasions to obtain full disclosure from the Minister of materials showing the course of dealings between the Canadian and American authorities.  This disclosure was refused on both occasions on the basis that the Department of Justice did not possess the requested information, and in any event, that such disclosure was not appropriate in the extradition context.  In his submissions to the Minister, Mr. Dynar’s counsel also invoked compassionate grounds related to some of Mr. Dynar’s health problems, and argued that Mr. Dynar should be prosecuted in Canada.  All of these submissions were rejected by the Minister, who refused Mr. Dynar’s request to re‑open the extradition hearing, and ordered his surrender for prosecution in the United States.  12Mr. Dynar appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal from Keenan J.’s committal decision, and sought judicial review of the Minister’s decision to order his surrender.  Galligan J.A., for a unanimous court, allowed the appeal and the application for judicial review on the basis that the activities of Mr. Dynar would not constitute a criminal offence in Canada, even though they did constitute an offence under the applicable United States law: (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 559, 85 O.A.C. 9, 101 C.C.C. (3d) 271.  Mr. Dynar was therefore discharged.  13The Minister of Justice and the United States have appealed Mr. Dynar’s discharge and Mr. Dynar has brought a cross‑appeal. ",

            "15                               Finlayson J.A. was also concerned with the trial judge’s separate reasons for imposing the indeterminate sentence.   He noted that the trial judge should not have derived any comfort from the fact that the Criminal Code  requires the National Parole Board to intermittently review a person’s dangerous offender status.  According to Finlayson J.A., in doing so, the trial judge effectively abdicated his responsibilities as sentencing judge.",
            "(1)  Must a trial judge, when evaluating a dangerous offender application under s. 753 (b) of the Criminal Code , focus on the seriousness of the specific predicate offences that have led to the Crown’s dangerous offender application?",
            "17                               It is the stated opinion of this Court that Robert Currie was properly designated a dangerous offender and correctly sentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration.  That opinion is grounded in two basic legal propositions both of which I develop and apply below.  Those propositions are: first, given the nature and structure of s. 753 (b) of the Criminal Code , a presiding trial judge need not focus on the objective seriousness of a predicate offence in order to conclude that a dangerous offender designation is warranted.  Second, a finding of dangerousness by a trial judge is a finding of fact, frequently based upon the competing credibility of experts, and as long as it is reasonable, it is a finding which should not be lightly overturned.",
            "18                                The Court of Appeal quashed the trial judge’s designation of Robert Currie as a dangerous offender principally because it found the trial judge erred by failing to focus on the seriousness of the predicate offences.  The respondent has relied upon that finding and insists that, when evaluating the likelihood of danger that an offender presents, the sentencing judge must consider the relative gravity of the predicate offences.  Unless  there is “some rational relationship between the predicate offences and the sentences”, the respondent contends that the offender is being sentenced for his past criminality.",
            "19                               It is true that, when viewed in isolation, the predicate offences appear less serious than much of the respondent’s past conduct.  Indeed the appellant has admitted that “[t]he predicate offences in this case are properly characterized as offences of a less serious nature than the offender’s earlier offences, and thankfully do not approach the gravity of the very violent earlier offences”.  However, that observation does not necessarily translate into a conclusion that the designation of Robert Currie as a dangerous offender was misplaced.   Rather, once an individual has committed an offence specifically defined in the Criminal Code  as a “serious personal injury offence”, he or she has made it possible for the Crown to invoke the Criminal Code ’s dangerous offender application process.  If that process is invoked, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to evaluate the offender’s potential danger to the public and this may or may not depend upon the specific nature and objective gravity of the predicate offence.",

        ],
        "Facts": " 2The respondent, Robert Currie, was charged with three counts of sexual assault, for a series of related incidents in which he sexually touched a number of young girls on November 5, 1988 in a Towers department store in Barrie, Ontario.  During the first incident, the respondent approached a group of four girls in the Towers toy section, felt and squeezed the buttocks of three of them, and left the area.  During the second, more invasive incident, the respondent followed a group of three sisters near the store’s tobacco department.  At first, he placed his hand on the eldest girl’s breast.  Immediately  thereafter, he approached the girls from behind and, as the trial judge described, “swept his hand between the legs of two of them in an attempt to touch their genitals”.  The frightened girls notified store employees and security personnel who eventually apprehended the respondent outside the store and awaited the arrival of the police.  3The respondent was convicted of all charges on April 12, 1989 before Tobias J.   Prior to sentencing, the Attorney General for Ontario initiated dangerous offender proceedings pursuant tos. 753(b) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.   Section 753(b) essentially provides that the Crown may apply to have an offender declared a “dangerous offender” and sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment if: (a)  he has been convicted of a “serious personal injury offence”; and (b) his failure to control his sexual impulses reveals “a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons” in the future.  A “serious personal injury offence” is defined ins. 752of theCriminal Codeto include all forms of sexual assault.  4These sexual assaults were not isolated incidents.  Part of the rationale for seeking to have the respondent declared a dangerous offender was his lengthy history of sexual offences that occurred in the Ottawa, Toronto and Hamilton regions between 1975-1988.   As outlined in disturbing detail in the judgments below and in the pleadings filed before this Court, the respondent had been previously convicted of numerous sexual offences, some of which were extremely violent and highly degrading to the victims.  5Robert Currie’s criminal sexual activity began in and around Ottawa between September and November 1975.  In separate incidents, the respondent stalked and sexually attacked four women.  All four of the incidents were serious  and  frightening for the victims, but two were comparatively more severe.  On September 30, 1975, the respondent followed a teenage girl into a field.  He caught her, undressed her and forced her to perform fellatio and engage in repeated acts of sexual intercourse.  When she resisted he pulled her hair and struck her in the face.  On November 29, 1975, later on the same night that he had indecently assaulted another victim, the respondent stalked a young woman in Nepean.  After approaching her from behind and striking her to the ground, he forced her into the deep snow of a deserted field.  He then undressed his victim completely, repeatedly struck her in the face, forced her to perform fellatio, and forced her to submit to multiple acts of anal and vaginal intercourse.  He had a hunting knife in his possession during the rape with which he threatened the victim after the attack.  She was bleeding heavily when he abandoned her naked in the snow.  6As a result of these attacks, on May 20, 1976, the respondent was convicted of  indecent assault, rape, and possession of a weapon and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.  Since that time, whenever he was at large, his sexually impulsive criminal behaviour continued.  In 1979, while on parole in Toronto, the respondent stalked and attacked a woman.  When she screamed in response to his attempt to touch her genitals, he jammed his fingers into her mouth, pushed her to the ground and kicked her.  He fled the scene, but was immediately apprehended by police and subsequently convicted of indecent assault.  In Hamilton in 1981 and 1982, while under intensive police surveillance, the respondent was observed following and stalking a number of women through the city streets.  In one case, the girl sensed she was being followed and sought shelter on the porch of a nearby home.  In another case, the respondent indecently assaulted  a woman he had been following by putting his hand under her clothing between her legs in an effort to touch her genitals.  When arrested by police for the latter incident, the respondent stated:  It was me I did it. I couldn’t help myself.  I asked for help before but they  released me.  I needed help but they let me go.  I was going to play hockey and I picked this girl up hitchhiking.  She was wearing a bathing suit.  I got all turned on.  It was like she was asking for it.  Not this one but the other one.  How do you guys do it?  I mean when you see these girls wearing bathing suits all day.  I need help.  I am always stalking women, little kids, and people.  I can’t stop.... I can’t help myself.... I’m always thinking about women.... I didn’t mean to harm anybody.  I guess I figure its just a few seconds of being frightened and its all over and nobody is hurt.   A.Psychiatric Evidence  7To substantiate its dangerous offender application, the Crown elicited the testimony of a psychiatrist, Dr. Angus McDonald, who participated in a two-month team assessment of the respondent after the commission of the recent Towers department store sexual assaults -- the so-called “predicate offences”.   Dr. McDonald evaluated the respondent as an obsessed and extremely temperamental “sexual deviate” who had a “biological anomaly in the wiring of his brain”.  As such he was “a very dangerous person to society”.  In making these findings, Dr. McDonald was influenced by the admission the respondent made to a psychometrist at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in 1989, in which he stated:  [The] stuff I was doing in ’79, I got rid of that.  I don’t bruise them now but don’t get me wrong.  They had better give me sex if I want it because I often have a knife and I always have my hands.   By way of conclusion, Dr. McDonald gave the prognosis that the respondent “was not open to treatment any longer and posed a risk to women and female children”.  8The defence-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Basil Orchard, acknowledged that the respondent suffered from an impulsive personality disorder and “a polymorphous sexual deviation” that includes “voyeurism, heterosexual pedophilia and hebephilia and impulsive sexual aggressiveness”.  Given this diagnosis, he admitted that there was a likelihood that the respondent would re-offend.  Dr. Orchard did conclude, however, that the respondent was neither schizophrenic nor psychotic and that he had shown change toward less violent behaviour.  He prognosticated that if there were future recurrences of the respondent’s criminal behaviour, his conduct would tend toward “nuisance-type offences” rather than offences of a violent nature.  In sum, he did not “find him particularly dangerous at the present time”.   B.Reasons on the Dangerous Offender Application  9Given the evidence before him, Tobias J. concluded that the respondent was, in fact, a dangerous offender unders. 753(b) of theCriminal Code.  In reaching  this decision, he preferred the evidence of Dr. McDonald to that of Dr. Orchard, finding the latter’s report to be “ambiguous and disjunctive”.   He also indicated that he was particularly influenced by the respondent’s most recent admission, post-dating the commission of the predicate offences, in which he openly admitted that he has been having irrepressible thoughts about sex with young children.  Tobias J. also concluded that treatment was unlikely to repress these stated urges, particularly given the respondent’s failure to admit the need for it and his ambivalence toward the impact of his most recent behaviour.  10On the specific subject of the predicate offences, Tobias J. endorsed Dr. McDonald’s conclusion  that “[a]lthough the predicate offences may appear less serious from an assaultive aspect,  they are more blatant, indicating a lessening of control on the part of the respondent”.  In response to defence counsel’s specific plea that the predicate offences exhibited a decline in danger, Tobias J. stated the following:  I have not been unmoved by the submissions of counsel for the respondent that the character of his behaviour has changed markedly over a period of 15 years from violent to harmless, with the result that the respondent cannot now be described as dangerous.  Nonetheless, these submissions have failed to persuade me that the violence and the brutality of the respondent’s early sexual assaults do not continue to be evidenced in the pattern of his subsequent sexual assaults, including that conduct which resulted in his conviction upon the predicate offences.   11Given all of his findings, Tobias J. indicated that, pursuant tos. 753of theCriminal Code, he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that: (a) Robert Currie had been convicted of “serious personal injury offences”; and (b) his conduct since 1975, including the commission of the predicate offences, demonstrated a failure to control his sexual impulses and presented an existing likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other members of society.  He granted the Crown’s dangerous offender application.  C.Reasons on Sentence  12Having granted the dangerous offender application, Tobias J. then turned his mind to the issue of sentencing.  In doing so, he alluded to the fact that, unders. 761(1)of theCriminal Code, the National Parole Board is statutorily required to intermittently review the dangerous offender designation.  He stated:  S. 761(1)of theCriminal Codeprovides a framework by which the National Parole Board considers the incarceration of an individual sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, and in my respectful opinion, it is in that protection of the review set out in s. 761(1) that Mr. Currie will receive the consideration of his personality disorder, the status of that personality disorder, the status of his sexual deviation, and whether at a time in the future, he no longer is a dangerous offender and a threat to the public.  I cannot say that in five years or six years or ten years that will occur.  I must therefore sentence Mr. Currie to an indeterminate period in the penitentiary and leave to the evaluation by experts in the National Parole Board and in the penitentiary system the status of Mr. Currie’s treatment and his right to re-enter society.  Acknowledging that the purpose of s. 753(b) is the protection of the public, Tobias J. exercised his statutory discretion and imposed an indeterminate sentence.  D.Ontario Court of Appeal(1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 444 (perBrooke, Finlayson and           Carthy JJ.A.)   13On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had wrongfully declared the respondent a dangerous offender and sentenced the respondent to time served.   According to Finlayson J.A., the dangerous offender designation was not supported by the evidence.  Although the previous sexual offences committed by the respondent were, at times, violent and extremely degrading, he noted (at p. 448) that the predicate offences were “not nearly as serious” and that the trial judge erred by failing to focus on the seriousness of the predicate offences themselves.  In this respect, Finlayson J.A. criticized the nature of Dr. McDonald’s evidence and preferred the report of Dr. Orchard which concluded that the “relatively mild nature of the [accused’s] predicate offences suggested that treatment had helped him to control his violent tendencies” (p. 451).  14The Court of Appeal also held that the trial judge’s decision was premised upon a misconception of the burden of proof.  Finlayson J.A. interpreted the trial judge’s concluding comment, as I have quoted above, that the respondent’s submissions have “failed to persuade me that the violence and the brutality of the respondent’s early sexual assaults do not continue to be evidenced” as an improper reversal of the burden of proof upon the respondent.  15Finlayson J.A. was also concerned with the trial judge’s separate reasons for imposing the indeterminate sentence.   He noted that the trial judge should not have derived any comfort from the fact that theCriminal Coderequires the National Parole Board to intermittently review a person’s dangerous offender status.  According to Finlayson J.A., in doing so, the trial judge effectively abdicated his responsibilities as sentencing judge.

The dancer would sit on the patron’s lap with her back to the patron and her bare buttocks on the patron’s groin area.  The trial judge summarized the sexual activity as follows:  The conduct of each dancer with the customer is clearly detailed in the evidence, and includes: (a) being nude except for wearing an open shirt or blouse; (b) fondling her own breasts, buttocks, thighs and genitals while close to the customer; (c) sitting on a customer’s lap and grinding her bare buttocks into his lap; (d) sitting on a customer’s lap, reaching into his crotch and apparently masturbating the customer; (e) permitting the customer to touch and fondle her breasts, buttocks, thighs and genitals; (f) permitting the customer to kiss, lick and suck their breasts; (g) permitting what appeared to be cunnilingus.   5The appellants were charged with, being the manager or agent or person in charge, allowing an indecent performance to be presented contrary tos. 167(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.  At trial, both appellants were acquitted.  The Crown appealed and a unanimous five-judge panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals and entered convictions against both appellants.

After his appointment to the Senate, the accused continued to make representations to the various levels of government on behalf of Guy Montpetit’s companies for the purpose of obtaining grants.  These representations were made in particular to a federal‑provincial committee chaired at the time by one Gabriel Voyer.  All the accused’s efforts to obtain grants for Guy Montpetit’s companies were in vain.  The accused also approached the Secretary of State at the time, Mr. Lucien Bouchard, to obtain the contract to translate Saskatchewan’s legislation for one of Guy Montpetit’s companies, but was unsuccessful.  It can be seen from the evidence that the accused was very effective in having ministers and senior officials meet in order to “advance” his client’s business.  It can also be seen from the evidence that while he appeared to be very good at having these people meet very quickly, the meetings never had the expected success, as no grants were awarded to Guy Montpetit’s companies.  For all these fruitless approaches to governments, for corporate law work and for approaches to private investors, the accused received fees totalling $162,000.00 for the period referred to in the charge.  Furthermore, Guy Montpetit granted the accused a loan in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in May 1986, and an accountant named St‑Laurent whose evidence was also the subject of an admission was unable to find any indication that it had been repaid.   4.After hearing submissions, the trial judge ruled that the Crown had failed to establish that the respondent possessed themens rearequired by the section and entered a verdict of acquittal:  [1993] Q.J. No. 1007 (QL).  The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal: [1996] Q.J. No. 133 (QL), J.E. 96-408, 31 W.C.B. (2d) 246. ",

        "Facts": "   6InSteinberg,supra, the accused was convicted of murder in the gruesome death of his partner who was shot and later found burned in his Toronto office.  One of the issues on appeal was whether the trial judge had erred by instructing the jury to consider that the perpetrator was one of the deceased’s partners because the eyewitness described the killer’s entry into the office as though it were made with a key.  In a judgment upholding the conviction, later affirmed by this Court, Middleton J.A. asserted at p. 36:  It may be that the evidence is very largely circumstantial, but the actual facts are known to the accused, and he has the right, under the laws as they now exist, to explain them away by his own evidence.  For example, he is not directly shown to have been in possession of his gun at the time of the murder.  He was in possession of it at an earlier date.  It may have been a mere coincidence that the victim was shot by this gun, and that the accused was at the time of the murder only a few yards away.  It is possible that the gun had been stolen from his residence by the murderer.  If so, he could have testified to the fact, and the jury might have accepted his explanation.  He might have been able to explain how the cartridge, which apparently fell from the revolver while he was in the room, came to be there.  He may have a satisfactory explanation as to how blood-stained overalls came to be found in his room.  He might be able to deny that he made the compromising statements to the gaol inmates, and the jury might readily have believed that the stories told were incredible; but, notwithstanding all the damning chain of evidence, he chooses to maintain silence.  No comment may be made upon this to the jury, but the law does not forbid jurors to use their intelligence and to consider the absence of denial or explanation.    7None of these early cases suggests that the accused should be compelled to testify or that the accused is anything other than presumed innocent until proven guilty.  They merely recognize that when an accused is implicated or “enveloped” in a case of unexplained inculpatory circumstances, there are consequences to silence that trial judges, juries, and appellate courts alike may consider in reaching a verdict.  This does not happen in every case.  A trier of fact is entitled to draw adverse inferences only where there is a “damning chain of evidence” or more aptly a “strong and cogent network of inculpatory facts”.

        "Facts": " 9.The offence of  aiding or abetting possession of a narcotic is a permissible legal result and has occurred on many occasions: see for example,R. v. Miller(1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 54 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 87;ReChambers and The Queen(1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.);Zanini v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 715.  10.In my view, this approach also offers a number of advantages.  First, I believe it accords with the general notion that the “punishment” should be in accord with the crime: Eric Colvin,Principles of Criminal Law(2nd ed. 1991), at p. 28.   A trafficking conviction, in the circumstances indicated above, is quite harsh, carries with it considerable stigma and has negative consequences for the repute of justice.  In this regard, it is also worth noting that the sentencing structure for these offences is rather disparate.  A trafficking conviction is punishable by up to life imprisonment, while a possession conviction carries a maximum seven-year sentence.  11.Perhaps more importantly, I believe this approach benefits from a certain symmetry.  It is clear that someone whose acts are designed to aid a purchaser, yet incidentally benefit the seller, has assisted much more in the purchase of the narcotic than in the sale.  As such, it is only fitting that this person share the culpability and stigma of the purchaser rather than that of the vendor.  12.Moreover, it addresses the concern set out at para. 32 by Cory J. that “[i]f the same exception which applies to purchasers were extended to agents for the purchaser, then the agents could escape culpability entirely”.  In my view, this is a valid concern which is certainly not ignored by this approach; where the facts warrant it, agents or people assisting a purchaser could well face a conviction for aiding or abetting possession of a narcotic.  13.In the case at bar, however, I have no difficulty concluding that the appellant did far more than act as a purchaser.  My colleague has described the nature of the appellant’s participation in the sale in detail, and these facts demonstrate a concerted effort on his part to effect the transfer of narcotics.  The appellant located the seller, brought the buyer to the site and introduced the parties.  It is clear that without this assistance, the purchase would never have taken place.  Moreover, he acted as a spokesperson, negotiated the price of the drugs, and passed the money over to the seller.  He also accepted money for having facilitated the deal.  As my colleague points out, without the appellant’s assistance, the buyer would never have been able to enter the apartment building and contact the seller.  These are not the acts of a mere purchaser, and as a result it is clear that the appellant aided the traffic of narcotics.  14.With respect to the required intention to commit such an offence under s. 21(1)(b) of theCode, and whether it was established in this case, I am in complete agreement with the approach taken by my colleague.  15.I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Cory J.    //Cory J.//  The reasons of Cory, McLachlin and Major JJ. were delivered by  16Cory J.-- A purchaser of narcotics can be found guilty of possession of drugs or possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking.  As a result of this exposure to criminal prosecution for these offences it has been determined that a purchaser of drugs cannot be convicted of aiding or abetting a vendor of drugs.  Courts have differed as to the culpability of one who assists the purchaser.  In some cases it has been held that, since the purchaser could not be found guilty of aiding and abetting, someone assisting the purchaser must also be found not guilty.  Other decisions appear to come to a different conclusion.  The question which must be addressed on this appeal is whether a person who aids or abets a purchaser of drugs should be found guilty as a party to the illegal drug transaction.

        "Facts": " 2The appellant, Margaret Ann Malott, and the deceased, Paul Malott, were common law spouses for about 19 years and had two children together.  The appellant had previously been married for seven years to a man who violently abused her and their five children.  Mr. Malott abused Mrs. Malott physically, sexually, psychologically and emotionally.  She had gone to the police, but Mr. Malott was a police informant on drug deals and the police told him of her complaints, resulting in an escalation of his violence towards her.  A few months before the shooting, Mr. Malott separated from the appellant, took their son and went to live with his girlfriend, Carrie Sherwood.  Mrs. Malott and their daughter continued to live at Mr. Malott’s mother’s house.  Contact between Mr. and Mrs. Malott continued after the separation, as he dropped by his mother’s home on a regular basis, often bringing Ms. Sherwood with him.  3On March 23, 1991, Mrs. Malott was scheduled to go to a medical centre with the deceased to get prescription drugs for use in the deceased’s illegal drug trade.  She took a .22 calibre pistol from Mr. Malott’s gun cabinet, loaded it and carried it in her purse.  After driving to the medical centre with Mr. Malott, she shot him to death.  She then took a taxi to Ms. Sherwood’s home, shot her and stabbed her with a knife.  Ms. Sherwood survived and testified as a Crown witness.  4At trial, the appellant testified to the extensive abuse which she had suffered.  The Crown conceded that the appellant had been subject to terrible physical and mental abuse at the hands of Mr. Malott.  The appellant led expert evidence to show that she suffered from battered woman syndrome.  The appellant raised three defences:  self-defence, drug-induced intoxication and provocation, but relied primarily on self-defence.  The jury found the appellant guilty of second degree murder in the death of Paul Malott and of attempted murder of Carrie Sherwood.  The jury made a recommendation that because of the severity of the battered woman syndrome, the appellant should receive the minimum sentence.  5The appellant appealed both convictions.  The appeal was heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal on May 28, 1996.  It is only the conviction for second degree murder of the deceased that is before this Court.

        "Facts": " 3The respondent, Consumers’ Gas Company Limited (“Consumers’ Gas” or “CG”), is a regulated utility which provides natural gas to commercial and residential customers throughout Ontario.  Its rates and payment policies are governed by the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB” or “Board”) pursuant to theOntario Energy Board Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.13, and theMunicipal Franchises Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.55.  The respondent cannot sell gas or charge for gas-related services except in accordance with rate orders issued by the Board.  4Consumers’ Gas bills its customers on a monthly basis, and each bill includes a “due date” for the payment of current charges.  The due date normally falls on the 10th day (for commercial customers) or the 16th day (for residential customers) after the bill is issued.  Customers who do not pay by the due date incur a late payment penalty (“LPP”) calculated at five percent of the unpaid charges for that month.  The LPP is a one-time penalty, and does not compound or increase over time.  Customers can avoid the LPP by participating in a pre-authorized payment system, whereby the amount of their monthly bill is deducted automatically on the due date from a designated bank account.  5Consumers’ Gas offers its customers two billing plans.  Under the normal plan, customers are simply billed for the cost of goods and services which they consume each month.  Under the “Equal Billing Plan”, CG estimates the customer’s yearly consumption, bills an equal amount each month for 10 months, settles any balance in the 11th month, and bills for actual use in the 12th.  About half of CG’s customers subscribe to each type of plan.  Late-paying customers are subject to the LPP regardless of which plan is used.  6The LPP was implemented in 1975 following a series of rate hearings conducted by the OEB.  In granting CG’s application to impose the penalty, the Board noted that the primary purpose of the LPP is to encourage customers to pay their bills promptly, thereby reducing the cost to CG of carrying accounts receivable.  The Board also held that such costs, along with any special collection costs arising from late payments, should be borne by the customers who cause them to be incurred, rather than by the customer base as a whole.  In approving a flat penalty of five percent, the OEB rejected the alternative course of imposing a daily interest charge on overdue accounts.  The Board reasoned that an interest charge would not provide sufficient incentive to pay by a named date, would give little weight to collection costs, and might seem overly complicated.  The Board recognized that if a bill is paid very soon after the due date, the penalty can, if calculated as an interest charge, be shown to represent a very high rate of interest.  However, it noted that customers could avoid such a charge by paying their bills on time, and that in any event in the case of the average bill the dollar amount of the penalty would not be very large.  7On several occasions since its adoption, the LPP has been reviewed and re-approved by the OEB in essentially the same form.  From 1981 until 1989, rate orders issued by the Board with regard to Consumers’ Gas incorporated the following provision (applicable to residential customers):  PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT:  When payment in full is not made within sixteen (16) days of the date of mailing, or the hand delivery of the bill, a penalty of five per cent (5%) of the current amount billed shall be levied....  Beginning in 1989, CG rate orders incorporated this statement from the respondent’s Handbook of Rates and Distribution Services (applicable to all customers): ",

        "Facts": "3On April 12, 1991, a Montreal taxicab was found submerged in the Madawaska River near Arnprior, Ontario.  The body of the taxi’s driver, Octavio Velasquez, was only discovered two months later in a secluded area several kilometres away.  An autopsy revealed that Velasquez had died from multiple stab wounds to the back.  There was no question that Velasquez had been murdered; the sole issue at trial was whether Ménard had killed him.  4At about 2:00 p.m. on April 12, Jack Schultz, a worker at a water filtration plant in Arnprior, saw a taxicab driving near the Madawaska River, and several minutes later he heard a splash.  When he approached the riverbank he observed a car sinking into the water and saw the appellant standing nearby with a duffle bag and a bundle of white clothing.  Schultz called the police; they arrived some three minutes later.  5Constable Nicholas of the Ontario Provincial Police saw the partly submerged taxi, and Ménard crouching at the top of a hill.  He called for Ménard to come down and proceeded to question him about what had happened.  Ménard stated that he had been hitchhiking from Ottawa and was picked up by a man named Phil, who was drinking alcohol and driving “crazy”.  Phil allegedly stopped the car at the top of the hill above the river, told the appellant “[t]he ride ends here, get out”, and then drove the car into the water and ran away.  Ménard gave a description of Phil and indicated the direction in which Phil had allegedly fled on foot.  6Other officers soon arrived on the scene.  They examined the area where the car had entered the water and found one set of footprints, which did not head in the direction of Phil’s ostensible flight from the scene.  The police climbed to where the appellant had been crouching and located a bundle of wet clothes, consisting of a white trench coat, a pair of jeans, socks and black boots.  The coat and jeans were stained with blood.  In the pocket of the jeans, Constable Nicholas found a ledger sheet in Ménard’s name from a military credit union.  He asked Ménard who owned the wet clothes.  Ménard initially claimed that they were Phil’s; however, when confronted with the ledger sheet, he admitted that the jeans were his but maintained that the rest of the clothing belonged to Phil.  Constable Nicholas arrested Ménard for possession of a stolen car.  7When the taxicab was removed from the river, blood stains were found on the driver’s seat and headrest as well as on the floor around the driver’s seat.  Forensic tests revealed that those stains were consistent with the victim’s blood group, which was shared by only 0.83 percent of the population.  Stains consistent with the victim’s blood were also found on Ménard’s jeans and on the other clothing retrieved from the hill where Ménard had been crouching, as well as on underwear that Ménard had in his duffle bag.  The back of the reversible cap that Ménard carried in his pocket also had approximately 40 spatter stains on it.  A black-handled knife, in its sheath, was recovered from the river near where the taxicab had been found.  No forensic evidence was introduced to connect the knife to the appellant.  8After the body of Octavio Velasquez was discovered on June 9, 1991, Constable Nicholas took soil samples from the area where the body was found.  He also took soil samples from the area where the wet clothing was found and where the taxicab entered the river.  These various samples were analysed by a forensic geologist, William Graves, who also examined some debris brushed from Ménard’s boots.  It was concluded that part of the debris from the boots was indistinguishable from the body-site soil samples.  9In addition to the foregoing circumstantial evidence, the Crown also introduced identification evidence from several motorists who testified to seeing a Montreal taxicab on the highway between Montreal and Ottawa.  Only one of these witnesses, Sidney Ritchie, actually placed Ménard in the taxicab with the deceased.  Ritchie’s evidence was challenged at trial on the ground that Ritchie had failed to pick the appellant out of a photo lineup and had only been able to make a positive identification at the preliminary inquiry, when the appellant was the only man in the room aside from counsel and court staff.  Moreover, Ritchie had been advised at that time that the appellant was the person charged with the murder.  10At his trial, Ménard gave a different version of events from what he had told Constable Nicholas at the time of his arrest.  He testified that he had been hitchhiking from Montreal when he was picked up by Phil, who was driving a Montreal Co-op Taxi.  Phil allegedly drove the taxi for five or ten minutes, then pulled over, told the appellant to keep the car, and left in another car that had pulled up behind the taxi.  When Phil stepped out of the taxi, Ménard allegedly noticed that Phil’s back was spotted with blood and that some brown staining was also visible on the driver’s seat.  Ménard testified that he assumed the car must have been stolen by Phil; nevertheless, he got into the driver’s seat and drove on because he did not know what else to do.  After driving for a short period of time, he allegedly stopped in the parking lot of a shopping mall and concluded that he had made a bad decision.  His own clothes were now stained from sitting in the driver’s seat and he was nervous about being in possession of the taxi.  He decided to dispose of the vehicle, and did so by pushing it into the nearby Madawaska River.  Ménard admitted that he had initially lied to Constable Nicholas about owning the blood-stained clothes and about pushing the taxi into the river, but he testified that he had done so because he panicked.

        "Facts": " 4In the autumn of 1991, the RCMP initiated a reverse sting operation involving undercover officers posing as large-scale hashish vendors.  This operation was undertaken after Corporal Richard Reynolds of the RCMP became aware of the decision of the Quebec Superior Court inR. v. Lore(an unreported decision of Pinard J., March 8, 1991, No. 500-01-013926-891) which, in Cpl. Reynolds’ view, gave implicit approval to a reverse sting operation in which police offered to sell narcotics to suspected drug traffickers.  Cpl. Reynolds contacted Mr. James Leising, an experienced senior lawyer employed by the Department of Justice in Toronto, to obtain professional advice as to the legality of a reverse sting operation.  Seven or eight meetings were held between Cpl. Reynolds and the Department of Justice lawyer in relation to the proposed operation.  In September of 1991, approval by senior RCMP officers was given to initiate the reverse sting.  Using the help of a police informant, the police contacted two groups of potential purchasers through the appellant Shirose.  Negotiations with these groups included showing the hashish to prospective purchasers.  However, the RCMP was careful not to provide any samples, despite requests to do so.  The hashish remained under the control of the RCMP at all times.  The appellant Campbell eventually participated in the negotiations as a financier for one of the two groups and in January 1992, the appellant Campbell, with the help of the appellant Shirose, agreed to pay $270,000 for 50 kilograms of cannabis resin.  The retail value of these drugs at street level, as found by the trial judge, was close to $1 million.  Instead of receiving the expected 50 kilograms of cannabis resin in exchange for payment, however, the appellants were arrested and charged with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and conspiracy to possess cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking.  5In advance of the trial, to support their submission that if convicted, the proceedings should be stayed, the appellants sought to subpoena Mr. Leising from the Department of Justice to testify about the communications that had occurred with Cpl. Reynolds with respect to the legality of the reverse sting operation.  The trial judge quashed the subpoena on the grounds that the communications were protected by solicitor-client privilege and did not fall within one of the recognized exceptions.  Subsequently, during the application to stay the proceedings, counsel for the appellants sought to examine Cpl. Reynolds on the content of his communications with the Department of Justice.  Again the trial judge upheld the assertion of solicitor-client privilege and denied the appellants’ application to force disclosure of these communications.  Based on the admissible evidence, the trial judge then dismissed the stay of proceedings application.  The appellant Shirose was sentenced to six years in penitentiary.  The appellant Campbell was sentenced to nine years in penitentiary, plus forfeiture of the purchase price paid to the police.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants’ appeal except to remit the issue of forfeiture to the trial judge to await an application by the Attorney General, if he sees fit to make it, for forfeiture of the purchase price unders. 462.37of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.  Evidence of Police “Good Faith”  6On the return of the stay motion, the Crown set out to establish that the police had at all stages acted in good faith and in the belief that the reverse sting was legal.  At the application for a stay of proceedings hearing, counsel for the Crown questioned Cpl. Reynolds as follows:  Q. Was your project [the reverse sting operation] tailored on the outlines of the project or [sic] theLorecase?  A. Yes, sir.  Q. And it was your understanding as a result of theLorecase that that was lawful behaviour?  A. Yes, sir.   It emerged that Cpl. Reynolds had consulted the Department of Justice about the legality of the reverse sting.  Appellants’ counsel pursued this issue with Cpl. Reynolds as follows: Q. So to return then, based upon this [Lore] decision coming to your attention, did you also obtain any other advice regarding any concerns you might have had about this type of an operation?  A. Sought legal advice.  Q. And from whom did you seek legal advice?  A. The Department of Justice, Toronto.  Q. And was it one individual or more than one individual?  A. One individual.  Q. And who was that?  A. Mr. Leising.   The precise purpose of obtaining this legal advice came out under further questioning from appellants’ counsel, as follows:  Q. Now that you know what I am reading from sir, what I asked was, “The issues for which advice was sought concerned the propriety of the police posing as sellers of drugs to persons believed to be distributors of drugs.”  Is that accurate?  A. That’s correct.  Q. “The propriety of the police offering hashish for sale to persons believed to be distributors of hashish.”  Is that correct?  A. Yes, sir.  Q. “The release of a sample of hashish to certain of those persons.”  Is that correct?  A. Yes, sir.  Q. “The possible consequences to the members who engaged in such conduct.”  Is that correct?  A. Yes, sir.  ...  Q. When you went to Mr. Leising, were you concerned about any of the members of your force who did engage in this operation, being prosecuted?  A. That would have been one of the issues.  Q. And then to return to Officer Plomp’s certificate, the last thing he said is, “and the issue of entrapment.” Was that one of the items on the agenda with Mr. Leising?  A. Yes, sir.   The Crown successfully objected to counsel for the appellants questioning Cpl. Reynolds with respect to the actual advice given because of the claim of solicitor-client privilege.  The appellants’ counsel then attempted to use this objection to narrow the potential ambit of the Crown’s “good faith” argument:  So it is my respectful submission that the Crown certainly cannot argue that the police acted in good faith because they acted on legal advice, because we don’t know what legal advice they got.  We don’t know what qualifications or conditions were attached.  We don’t know whether they were told, ‘This is going to be illegal and you’re on your own.  You’re at risk.’ We don’t know if they were told, ‘It’s illegal but don’t worry, we’ll never prosecute you.’ ",

        "Facts": " 2On October 13, 1994 a chlor-alkali plant operated by the respondents (collectively referred to as “CanadianOxy”) in North Vancouver, British Columbia discharged a quantity of chlorine into the waters of Burrard Inlet, killing a number of fish.  This incident occurred during a three and a half hour power outage at the plant, as a result of one of two B.C. Hydro 60 kv power lines servicing the plant being struck by a tree.  3The company reported the discharge to the authorities and an investigation by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans followed.  Fishery Officer Robert Tompkins went to the plant that night, spoke with the Plant Chemist, and seized a number of documents.  He also seized samples of dead fish recovered in the vicinity of the plant by the Harbour Master’s patrol vessel.  He advised the Plant Manager that he had reasonable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed under theFisheries Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-14.  4Over a short time  Tompkins made three further visits to the plant, formally interviewed the Plant Chemist, was shown the valve which the company had identified as the cause of the discharge and was provided with certain documents.  His request to interview additional employees was refused.  5Tompkins subsequently made a written request to CanadianOxy’s counsel for additional technical information believed relevant for Environment Canada’s Pollution Abatement Division to assess whether the discharge had been preventable.  Only a few of these questions were answered.  6On March 16, 1995, five months after the discharge, Tompkins swore an information and obtained a warrant to search the respondents’ plant for a range of documents relating to process records, plant maintenance, employee training, discipline, and general plant operations.  In the information, Tompkins described the reasons for seeking this information:  The business records . . . are required to establish and prove that CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. . . .  operate a chlor‑alkali plant that discharges effluent to the waters of Burrard Inlet near North Vancouver, B.C., that the release of effluent with a chlorine concentration exceeding 10 ppm, which I know would be acutely lethal to fish, occurred on October 13, 1994, and that the company could have taken additional reasonable measures to prevent the release of a deleterious substance into water frequented by fish....  . . . I have reasonable grounds to believe that correspondence had been generated by company personnel in January 1994, and that maintenance was performed in March 1994, and again in October 1994, and that the company conducted their own investigation, prepared reports, and provided information regarding the incident until February 1995. . . .  It is necessary to examine effluent discharge records, effluent water quality sampling and analysis records, mechanical and instrument maintenance records, environmental control records, instrument calibration records and flow rate calculation records covering an extended period of time before and after October 13, 1994.  This will . . . permit analysis of the maintenance programs undertaken by CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd.  It is necessary to examine company personnel records covering the period between January 1, 1994 and February 28, 1995 . . . to determine if any company employees have been disciplined in any manner as a result of this incident. . . .  7The warrant was executed on March 17, 1995.  In total 139 items were seized pursuant to the warrant, and 73 additional items were seized under the investigators’ understanding of the “plain view” doctrine.  Following the search, Tompkins learned by coincidence of an adverse ruling by a British Columbia Provincial Court judge on the validity of a similar seizure in an unrelated case.  As a result, he sought legal advice with respect to a number of the items taken.  8On April 26, 1995, Tompkins made two applications to a Justice of the Peace, one for an order to return the documents which had been improperly seized under the first warrant, and the second for a new warrant to re-seize 13 of the items returned which were relevant to the investigation.   These orders were granted and executed the same day.  9On June 15, 1995 the respondents were charged with:  (a)   depositing, or permitting the deposit, of a deleterious substance in waters frequented by fish, contrary toss. 36(3)and40(2)of theFisheries Act; and (b)   introducing, or causing or allowing the introduction of waste into the environment, contrary to ss. 3(1.1) and 34(3) of theWaste Management Act, S.B.C. 1982, c. 41 (now R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 482).  10The respondents subsequently brought a motion to quash the warrants alleging thats. 487(1)of theCriminal Codehad been exceeded.  The warrants were broad enough to authorize a search for evidence of negligence which if found would negate a defence of due diligence.

        "Facts": " 7I do not propose to repeat Justice Bastarache’s summary of the facts except where necessary to explain our divergence in the result.  8The prelude to the knife attack was a day-long drive from the Okanagan Valley to Vancouver, during which, according to the appellant, his wife created an explosive situation by her aggressive verbal attacks.  The appellant had planned to take his sons out to dinner and a movie, but abandoned these plans because of his wife’s objection.  The appellant instead visited briefly with his sons.  His wife waited in the truck.  According to the appellant, his wife accelerated her attack on him upon his return to the driver’s seat.  She taunted him that his former wife had been “fucking all my friends” (while the two had been married) and that “[my sons] weren’t my kids at all”.  As the verbal abuse continued, he said, “I can see she’s losing it”, so he pulled into a vacant lot and “she’s still yelling at me that I’m nothing but a piece of shit”.  His wife then allegedly said she had told the police that he had been abusing her and that they were about to arrest him, and threatened to get a court order to force him out of their home leaving her in the house, collecting alimony and child support.  He says she told him that she felt sick every time he touched her, that he was a “lousy fuck” with a small penis, and that she would never have sex with him again.  As stated, a psychological report filed by the defence at trial characterized the comments attributed to Mrs. Stone as “exceptionally cruel, psychologically sadistic, and profoundly rejecting”.  9The appellant finally pulled off the highway in Burnaby to a vacant lot and described sitting in the truck with his head down, listening to his wife, and thinking that he and his boys did not deserve to be treated this way and “it’s just kind of fading away”.  From there, he said, he remembered only a “whooshing” sensation washing over him, from his feet to his head.  According to his account, when subsequently his eyes focussed, he was staring straight ahead and felt something in his hand.  He looked down and saw his wife slumped over on the seat.  He was holding the hunting knife that he kept stored in the truck.  His wife was dead, having been stabbed 47 times.  The appellant says that, at that time, he had no memory of stabbing his wife.

Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421.  He wrote, at p. 451 that “[w]hen there is nothing to connect the accused with a particular crime except bad character or similar crimes committed in the past, the probative value of the evidence is nil and the evidence is rejected on that ground”.  I think this statement may go too far, and find the approach taken by Lamer J., as he then was, inMorris,supra, is more accurate.  He stated, at p. 203: ",

        "Facts": " 38This Court has often stressed the importance of a factual basis inChartercases. See, for example,MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361;R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at pp. 762 and 767-68,perDickson C.J.;Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 83;Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099;Baron v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 452;DeSousa,supra, at p. 954;Canadian Broadcasting Corp.  v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480, at para. 15. These facts have been broken into two categories: legislative and adjudicative.  InDanson,supra, at p. 1099, Sopinka J., for the Court, outlined these categories as follows:  These terms derive from Davis,Administrative Law Treatise(1958), vol. 2, para. 15.03, p. 353. (See also Morgan, \"Proof of Facts in Charter Litigation\", in Sharpe, ed.,Charter Litigation(1987).) Adjudicative facts are those that concern the immediate parties: in Davis' words, \"who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or intent ....\" Such facts are specific, and must be proved by admissible evidence. Legislative facts are those that establish the purpose and background of legislation, including its social, economic and cultural context. Such facts are of a more general nature, and are subject to less stringent admissibility requirements: see e.g.,Re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373,perLaskin C.J., at p. 391;Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714,perDickson J. (as he then was), at p. 723; andReference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297,perMcIntyre J., at p. 318.   39The argument that the present appeal is premature rests on the contention that there are few adjudicative facts before the Court. Two points may be made in response.  40First, it is not clear what further adjudicative facts would arise if the respondent had gone through the impugned procedure and been refused production. Although, pursuant tos. 278.8(1)of theCriminal Code,  the trial judge must provide reasons for refusing to order production of any record, or part of any record, presumably these reasons could not divulge much about the content of the records in question for that would defeat the very purpose of the new provisions.  41Second, the record contains sufficient facts to resolve the issues posed by the present appeal. Indeed, no argument was made that the adjudicative facts, sparse as they may be, are insufficient.  Moreover, a determination that the legislation at issue in this appeal is unconstitutional in its general effect involves an assessment of the effects of the legislation under reasonable hypothetical circumstances.  InR. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, Gonthier J. stated, for the majority, at pp. 515-16: ",

        "Facts": " In light of the foregoing evidence, I am convinced that the appellant was wilfully blind as to whether the complainant consented.  Accordingly, the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent has no air of reality.  99I note that O’Neill J.A. also dissented on the grounds that the trial judge failed to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent in the cases of T.R. and D.A.S.  The appellant, however, made no submissions on this point in either oral or written arguments.  It is not clear whether this was an oversight, or a concession that there was no air of reality to the defence in either case and thus a waiver of this ground of appeal.  To rule out the possibility of a potentially harmful oversight and in an abundance of caution, I have reviewed the record, and am of the opinion that there was no air of reality to the defence.  The issue was simply one of consent or no consent in both cases.  E.Did the trial judge err in his application of the principle of reasonable doubt in the cases of all five complainants?  100The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in his application of the principle of reasonable doubt to each of the charges against him in the cases of all five complainants.  O’Neill J.A. in dissent held that the trial judge made two notable errors.  First, in each case the trial judge failed to consider all of the evidence in determining whether there was a reasonable doubt in the manner set out by this Court’s decision inR. v. W. (D.),supra.  Second, that in the cases of D.A.S. and T.R., the trial judge used language that suggests that he reversed the onus on the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant.  101At the beginning of his judgment, before dealing with any of the individual charges, the trial judge specifically referred toW. (D.).At paras. 3-5 he held:  . . . it is important to ensure that one applies the presumption of innocence to the accused in each of the cases.  The obligation is never lifted from the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the counts.  It has been pointed out in numerous cases that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which “convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience that the Crown has proven all the essential elements of the offence”: seeR. v. W. (D.). . . .  It has been said by a number of trial judges that it is incorrect to approach these cases in terms of whether or not one believes the defence’s evidence or the Crown’s evidence.  The correct approach is to ask oneself; even if I do not believe the evidence of the accused, whether or not, viewing the evidence as a whole, I have a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt. . .  .  It is important to review all of the testimony and consider the evidence in its totality in the broader context of the presumption of innocence and the requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt to finally reach a decision on each count.  102The trial judge clearly directed himself properly as to the principle of reasonable doubt.  His judgment also reveals a thorough review of the evidence.  While he did not specifically advert toW. (D.)while dealing with each count, this does not mean that he erred.  I agree with Green J.A. who held at pp. 325-26:  . . . the trial judge, near the beginning of his reasons for judgment, when dealing with general principles, specifically referred to and properly stated, the effect ofR. v. D. W.as it affects the application of the principle of reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility.  The fact that he did not repeat the admonition each time as he dealt with the facts of each count does not necessarily mean that he failed to consider or apply the principle in each case.  Just because a judge, after considering the evidence, decides to accept a complainant’s version of events over that of an accused’s does not mean he has fallen into the trap whichR. v. D. W.warns against.  103With respect to the cases of T.R. and D.A.S., in the course of reviewing the evidence, the trial judge said that he was “not convinced” that the complainants consented to the sexual activity in question.  Read out of context, these comments suggest that the trial judge may have reversed the burden of proof.  However, in my view, this is simply plucking colloquial elements of the trial judge’s thorough reasons.  I agree with Green J.A., who held at p. 316:  It is not sufficient to “cherry pick” certain infelicitous phrases or sentences without enquiring as to whether the literal meaning was effectively neutralized by other passages.  This is especially true in the case of a judge sitting alone where other comments made by him or her may make it perfectly clear that he or she did not misapprehend the import of the legal principles involved.  As McLachlin J. said in [R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1S.C.R. 717, at p. 737]: “[t]he fact that a trial judge misstates himself at one point should not vitiate his ruling if the preponderance of what was said shows that the proper test was applied and if the decision can be justified on the evidence.”  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.",

        "Facts": " 54Threshold reliability exists where there is a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness.  It does not mean that the hearsay is true or even likely to be true, but rather it asks whether the circumstances are such that there is sufficient reliability for the hearsay to be properly assessed by the jury.  The traditional hearsay exceptions are based on a determination of threshold reliability:Smith,supra, at pp. 929-30.   These exceptions have historically been founded on  truisms common to classes of people or common to circumstances applicable to all people.  There is no reason why that should not continue to be the case.  55I acknowledge that some of the existing exceptions may require fine tuning.  It may be that society has changed in such a manner that the rationale for the exception no longer applies.  And, there may be circumstances which could arise in an individual case which challenge the inherent reliability that underpins a hearsay exception.  However, the court must differentiate between individual circumstances that go to the weight of the evidence (such as motive to lie or other extraneous circumstances unique to the individual) and circumstances that are properly considered at the threshold stage.  56In re-evaluating a hearsay exception, the court must ask whether some reason exists to doubt that the rationale underlying the exception applies in certain circumstances.  The scope of this inquiry is restricted; the court should not consider every possible permutation of indicators of reliability or unreliability.  To do so would result in the excision of the categories and abolition of their utility.  Rather, the questions should always be: Is there something wrong with the exception itself?  Should the exception be inapplicable in some circumstances?  57The only time when a court should entertain a challenge to an existing exception is where there are facts, generally applicable to a class of persons, which weaken the theoretical justification for the exception.  If facts arise which demonstrate that within an exception, we no longer think that statements made by a particular class of persons are inherently reliable, then to a certain extent, the rationale for the exception has been displaced and the exception must be modified to exclude people in such circumstances.  For example, it may be that a court may wish to reconsider the dying declaration under certain circumstances such as when a dying person is under the influence of powerful drugs.  Another exemption that may benefit from re-examination is the business records exception where the records are written by persons who are not disinterested parties.  Both of these examples reflect particular circumstances under which  reliability may be questioned for all people in such a situation.  I believe that this approach will force the courts to reconsider the exceptions only where a problem exists with the theoretical foundation of the exception.  Furthermore, having the courts remember the reasons for the rule will prove very beneficial.  The problem with the exceptions was that they were thought to be “ossified judicially created categories” (Smith,supra, at p. 930), but this approach will foster a renewed understanding of the rationales underlying these categories.  58In sum, if one wishes to displace an exception, which is based on concepts of necessity and reliability, one will have to displace either necessity or the reliability upon which the exception is based. This can only be done where the circumstances would be generally applicable to a class of persons or in a particular circumstance faced by all persons.  59In principle, the trial judge’s residual discretion to exclude admissible evidence where its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value (Seaboyer,supra, at p. 611) could, in appropriate circumstances, apply to evidence falling within an exception to the hearsay rule: see, e.g.,Hawkins,supra, at para. 85.  This point was not addressed in the Court of Appeal and was not argued before this Court and therefore I see no need to undertake an analysis of the issue.  60I would summarize my position in the following terms which I believe are largely consistent with the approach taken by the British Columbia Court of Appeal inR. v. Chahley(1992),72 C.C.C. (3d) 193, andR. v. Collins(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 514.  First,Khanand its progeny permit hearsay evidence to be admitted in new situations where necessary and where indicia of reliability are present, but did not abolish the traditional exceptions.  Second, the traditional exceptions are largely consistent with the necessity-reliability criteria and so do not generally require revision.  Finally, the traditional exceptions may be modified or supplemented as appropriate to conform to the principled approach (on this last point, see Rosenberg, “B. (K.G.)– Necessity and Reliability: The New Pigeon-holes”,supra, at p. 71).  Trial judges should continue to apply the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule. ",

        "Facts": " 3The facts surrounding the respondent’s interrogation  are obviously central to the resolution of this appeal, and I will refer to them throughout my legal analysis.  At this point, I will simply give an overview.  4Between February 5, 1994 and April 4, 1995, a series of eight fires involving four buildings and two motor vehicles occurred in and around the community of Waterville, Nova Scotia.  Most of the incidents occurred between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.  The vehicle fires involved a van belonging to the respondent’s father, and a car belonging to the respondent’s fiancée, Tanya Kilcup.  The building fires occurred relatively close to where the respondent had lived when the various fires occurred.  The fires appeared to have been deliberately set, with the possible exception of Ms. Kilcup’s vehicle.  The respondent was a member of the Waterville Volunteer Fire Brigade, and had responded to each of the fires in that capacity.  5The last fire involved Ms. Kilcup’s vehicle.  The car was parked in the driveway of the apartment building where the respondent and Ms. Kilcup lived.  The fire was discovered by a passerby who extinguished it.  The Fire Marshall investigated the fire and concluded that since the car was subject to a prior recall for a possible faulty ignition switch, the fire may have been accidental owing to an electrical fault.  6The police also conducted an extensive investigation of the fires.  To help narrow the list of possible suspects, they asked a total of seven or eight individuals to submit to polygraph tests.  Five or six individuals did so, passed the test, and were effectively removed from the list of suspects. Another person had agreed to take a polygraph, but was not examined after the respondent confessed to the crimes.  The respondent, after initial doubts, agreed to submit to a test.  Around 3:00 p.m. on April 26, 1995, the respondent went to the Wandlyn Motel for the test, according to a prior arrangement.  The police audiotaped the events at the motel.  Sergeant Taker administered the polygraph test.  The respondent was fully advised of his rights to silence, to a lawyer (including the availability of Legal Aid), and to leave at any time.  Sergeant Taker also advised him that while Sergeant Taker’s interpretation of the polygraph results was not admissible, anything said by the respondent was admissible.  The respondent was given a pamphlet to review, which discussed the polygraph procedures, and he signed a consent form.  7Before conducting the test itself, Sergeant Taker conducted a lengthy “pre-test” interview, which involved a variety of questions, many of them personal in nature.  This interview was designed to provide a basis for the polygraph test itself, to help Sergeant Taker compose “control questions” for the polygraph exam, and to foster a sense of intimacy between examiner and subject.  An exculpatory statement, which formed the basis for the polygraph test itself, was taken at the conclusion of the pre-test.  Sergeant Taker then conducted the polygraph exam, which lasted only a matter of minutes.  During the test Sergeant Taker did not ask about any specific fire, but instead asked if the respondent’s earlier statement had been truthful.  At the conclusion of the test, around 5:00 p.m., Taker checked the charts and informed the respondent that he had failed the test.  He reminded the respondent that his rights were still in effect, and proceeded to question him for approximately one hour.  At one point the respondent asked “What if I admit to the car? ... Then I can walk out of here and it’s over.”  Though Sergeant Taker replied “You can walk out at any time”, the respondent did not leave.  8At 6:30 p.m. Sergeant Taker was relieved by Corporal Deveau, who reminded the respondent of his right to counsel.  After 30 to 40 minutes, the respondent confessed to setting fire to his fiancée’s car.  He appeared emotionally distraught at this time.  After a recitation of his rights, and an acknowledgement that he understood them, the police took a written statement, in which he continued to deny any involvement in the other fires.  The respondent was arrested, warned of his right to counsel, given the secondary police warning, and driven to the police station at 8:15 p.m.  En route he was very upset and was crying.  He was placed in an interview room equipped with videotaping facilities, which recorded the subsequent interrogation where Corporal Deveau questioned him about the other fires.  Around 8:30 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. the respondent indicated that he was tired, and wanted to go home to bed.  He was informed that he was under arrest, and he could call a lawyer if he wanted, but that he could not go home.  Questioning did not cease.  9Constable Bogle took over the interrogation at 9:52 p.m., after giving the respondent the secondary police warning.  Constable Bogle questioned the respondent until about 11:00 p.m., at which time the respondent confessed to setting seven of the eight fires.  He denied any involvement in the fire in his father’s van.  At this time, Constable Bogle left the room, and the respondent was seen crying with his head in his hands.   Constable Bogle returned with Corporal Deveau, and took a written statement.  The respondent’sCharterrights and the police warning were on the statement, and were acknowledged by the respondent.  The police warning stated that “[y]ou need not say anything.  You have nothing to hope from any promise or favour and nothing to fear from any threat whether or not you do say anything.  Anything you do say may be used as evidence.”  The statement concluded at 1:10 a.m. on April 27.  After the police attended to various administrative tasks, the respondent was placed in a cell to sleep at 2:45 a.m.  At 6:00 a.m., Corporal Deveau noticed that the respondent was awake and asked whether he would agree to a re-enactment.   On the tape of the re-enactment, the respondent was given aCharterwarning, the secondary warning, and was advised that he could stop the re-enactment at any time.  The police drove the respondent around Waterville to the various fire scenes, where he described how he had set each fire.  The respondent was charged with seven counts of arson.  10At trial, the trial judge held avoir direto determine the admissibility of the respondent’s statements, including the video re-enactment.  The trial judge ruled that the statements were voluntary and admissible, and subsequently convicted him on all counts.  However, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal found that the statements were involuntary and thus inadmissible, and allowed the respondent’s appeal.  The Court of Appeal excluded the confessions, overturned the convictions, and entered acquittals.

A.G., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, 2000 SCC 17.  In this trilogy, the Court was asked to reconsider its decision in R.  v.

The proper test is “whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered” (Yebes, supra, at p. 185).  In embarking on the exercise mandated by s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , the reviewing court must engage in a thorough re-examination of the evidence and bring to bear the weight of its judicial experience to decide whether, on all the evidence, the verdict was a reasonable one.  Inevitably the verdict will be one that was open to the jury, in the sense that it was not an error of law for the trial judge to leave it to the jury for consideration.  Moreover, it is not sufficient for the reviewing judge to simply take a different view of the evidence than the jury did.  The appeal court, if it is to overturn the verdict, must articulate the basis upon which it concludes that the verdict is inconsistent with the requirements of a judicial appreciation of the evidence.  This is what must now be done in this case.",

        "Facts": " 8The jury may therefore reject the opinion of experts, even when the experts called are unanimous and uncontradicted by other experts.  For example, inR. v. Mailloux(1985), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 171, the Ontario Court of Appeal was faced with a verdict rejecting purportedly uncontradicted expert evidence.  Lacourcière J.A., speaking for the court, stated at p. 177:  This Court is not at liberty to come to its own conclusion on the issue of insanity and thereby disregard the verdict pronounced by a jury.  Having regard to the statutory presumption of sanity, this Court ought not to interfere with the verdict of a jury unless on consideration of all the evidence, we are satisfied that it was one which no jury acting judicially and properly instructed could have reached. . . .  However, there has to be a rational foundation, in the evidence, for the jury to reasonably reject the opinion of the experts.  InMailloux, two eminent forensic psychiatrists had expressed the opinion that the appellant suffered from a paranoid personality disorder dating back to a period well before the shooting.  Lacourcière J.A. summarized more precisely the purport of their evidence at p. 173:  Both psychiatrists testified that the [accused] at the material time, by reason of psychotic delusions, was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that his acts were wrong.  They also agreed that the [accused] was incapable of forming the specific intent necessary to commit murder.  However, the opinions expressed in their evidence-in-chief were substantially qualified and diluted by the evidence which they gave during cross-examination, which was obviously accepted by the jury, to the effect that the [accused] knew that pulling the trigger would cause the gun to fire and that he was able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act and to understand the immediate physical consequence which would flow from it,i.e., that someone would be killed.  In particular, Dr. Orchard admitted in cross-examination that first the [accused] was capable of knowing that the act was wrong and was also capable of forming the specific intent to kill.  9The appellant had submitted that the verdict of murder was unreasonable in light of the uncontradicted psychiatric opinions coupled with the evidence of drug abuse, the absence of motive and the bizarre nature of the accused’s conduct before and after the shooting.  The Court of Appeal did not accept that argument and concluded at p. 177:  Dealing first with our power to substitute a verdict under s. 613(1)(d), there certainly was ample evidence upon which the jury could properly return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  However, we are satisfied that the evidence was also capable of reasonably supporting the jury’s conclusion, according to the view which they took of it, that the defence of insanity had not been proved by the accused on the balance of probabilities.  Mailloux,supra, was affirmed by this Court (seeR. v. Mailloux,[1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029).  Lamer J. (as he then was) stated at p. 1044:  Stated in technical terms, the finding by the jury was that the accused had not rebutted by a preponderance of evidence the presumption of sanity.  After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal’s finding that there was evidence supportive of the jury’s conclusion and that the verdict, in that regard, was not unreasonable.  10A proper understanding and weighing of expert opinion often plays a central role in the determination of whether or not an accused should be found not guilty by reason of mental disorder.  The absence of a Crown rebuttal expert to contradict an accused’s psychiatric evidence is not in itself sufficient to conclude that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable if that conclusion remained reasonably open to the jury on the totality of the evidence.  However, it may be unreasonable for a jury to disregard the expert evidence put before it, particularly where all the experts called were in agreement with each other, when their evidence was “uncontradicted and not seriously challenged” (R.v.Kelly(1971), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 186 (Ont. C.A.),at p. 186), and when there was nothing in the “conduct of the commission of the crime which would raise any serious question as to the validity of the psychiatrists’ conclusion” (Kelly, at p. 186).  Furthermore, appellate review of the reasonableness of the jury’s findings must be undertaken in light of the standard articulated inBiniaris,supra.

            "Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 691(1) (a).",
            "1                                   The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Alberta Court of Appeal erred in its conclusion that the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the reasonable doubt standard was in accord with the guidelines set out in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320.  That is, whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the use of certain words and phrases would have misled the jury in its task of understanding and applying the criminal standard of proof in their deliberations.",
            "4                                   The appellant appealed the conviction on the grounds, inter alia, that his rights to counsel and silence had been violated, that the trial judge had improperly instructed the jury on the issues of capacity and intent, and that the trial judge had misled the jury on the correct standard of proof.  The Alberta Court of Appeal unanimously rejected all but the last of these grounds.  With a dissenting opinion on the issue of whether the trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the appeal comes before this Court as of right pursuant to s. 691(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .",
            "There is a basic rule of law which applies in this case, as it does in every criminal case.  It’s the presumption of innocence and that’s been spoken about already.  The accused is presumed to be innocent until the Crown, his accuser, has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The presumption of innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case are inseparable.  The burden of proving the guilt of the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the Crown and that burden never shifts.  The Crown must prove each and every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, and I will shortly discuss the elements of the offence with you, and it’s simple, but you have to remember that the reasonable doubt standard applies only to the elements of the offence and to the guilt of the accused. . . .",
            "8                                          Hunt J.A., for the majority, accepted the decisions of Lifchus, supra, and R. v. Bisson, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 306, as authoritatively setting out the standard of review for jury instructions on the reasonable doubt standard of proof.  At the outset, she emphasized that the Lifchus review did not demand that any specific wording be used in the charge.  In addition, she noted that not every error would amount to a reversible error.  Rather, the centre of the analysis focuses on assessing whether the jury fully understood the requisite criminal standard of proof and, thus, considering the charge as a whole, the question to be asked is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended this standard of proof (para. 9).  With these principles in mind, Hunt J.A. reviewed each of the impugned aspects of the jury charge and ultimately held that she was not convinced that the jury had been left with a reasonable misapprehension about the correct standard of proof (para. 30).",
            "9                                   Both the Lifchus and Bisson decisions involved jury charges where the trial judge had explained that the words “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” were to be understood in an “ordinary” or “everyday life” sense.  While in both cases, Cory J., for the Court, held that directing a jury to understand the criminal standard of proof in an everyday context was misleading and constituted a reversible error (Lifchus, at para. 23; Bisson, at paras. 7-8), Hunt J.A. interpreted Lifchus and Bisson to mean that a reversible error arose only when this “everyday” language was used in the absence of other instructions more properly explaining the criminal standard of proof (para. 11).  Since “a great deal more was said to the jury about the concept of reasonable doubt” (emphasis in original) in Sulatycky J.’s jury charge, and, since these additional instructions were consistent with the Lifchus guidelines, they acted to cure the inappropriate direction (paras. 12-16).",
            "10                               Hunt J.A. noted that Cory J. had cautioned against the use of any words other than “reasonable” when qualifying the concept of “doubt” because describing the requisite level of doubt with the words “serious”, “haunting”, and “substantial” might lead to the application of a varying standard of proof either higher or lower than the requisite criminal standard (Lifchus, at para. 26).  Viewing the charge as a whole, Hunt J.A. held that the qualifying words used by Sulatycky J. were far less problematic than those identified by Cory J. and were not, therefore, fatal errors (para. 20).",
            "13                               Hunt J.A. turned to Lifchus’s caution that the use of morally expressive language might misdirect a jury away from an objective standard of proof.  Cory J. had stated that “if the standard of proof is explained as equivalent to “moral certainty”, without more, jurors may think that they are entitled to convict if they feel “certain”, even though the Crown has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt” (Lifchus, at para. 25 (emphasis added)).   Hunt J.A. applied this principle and concluded that, reading the charge as a whole, “much more” had been said and, as a result, the jury could not have misapprehended the standard as constituting a moral rather than a criminal standard of proof (para. 24).",
            "(vi)       The absence of an explanation of the difference between the proof required  in a civil case (balance of probability) and that required in a criminal case.",
            "14                               Cory J. specifically stated that it was important that jurors be told that they are not to apply a probabilities standard in the context of a criminal trial (Lifchus, supra, at para. 32).  Hunt J.A. found that this requirement arose from Cory J.’s concern that some jurors may have had experiences in civil cases and might inappropriately apply that standard in the criminal context.  Hunt J.A. considered it just as likely that a number of the jurors had no such experience and any discussion of the civil standard might well give rise to confusion.   In any case, Hunt J.A. held that the omission of these instructions was not serious in the context of the overall charge (para. 26).",
            "The criminal standard of proof has a special significance unique to the legal process.  It is an exacting standard of proof rarely encountered in everyday life, and there is no universally intelligible illustration of the concept, such as the scales of justice with respect to the balance of probabilities standard.  Unlike absolute certainty or the balance of probabilities, reasonable doubt is not an easily quantifiable standard.  It cannot be measured or described by analogy.  It must be explained.  However, precisely because it is not quantifiable, it is difficult to explain.",
            "21                              In the present case, as in others in the past, the trial judge’s instructions to the jury did not communicate the requisite standard of proof to the letter of Lifchus.  Specifically, the jury was not told that the standard was not one of absolute certainty, and was not told that more was required than the probability of guilt.   Yet, while the omission of an explanation that clarifies the requisite standard of proof in a criminal trial constitutes a defect, on its own, it will not necessarily cause a jury charge to fail.   As was stated in Avetysan, supra, at para. 11, the absence of one of the required ingredients of Lifchus, or the inclusion of one of the inappropriate elements, “will not usually be determinative of the validity of the charge as a whole”. Rather, the instructions given by the trial judge must be considered as a whole, and in the overall context of the case, to determine whether there was substantial compliance with Lifchus."

        "Facts": " 3The appellant was found guilty of second degree murder by a jury on September 27, 1996.  The incident giving rise to the charge occurred on July 27, 1995, when Kimberley Cahoon was shot in the neck and killed with a shotgun fired at close range.  The shooting occurred in the kitchen of the home that the appellant shared with another man.   At trial, the defence put forward the theory that the appellant’s house-mate had killed Ms. Cahoon.  This theory was grounded on the view that, given the appellant’s state of intoxication combined with the consequences of a prior brain injury, the appellant could not have formed the intent to kill.  4The appellant appealed the conviction on the grounds,inter alia, that his rights to counsel and silence had been violated, that the trial judge had improperly instructed the jury on the issues of capacity and intent, and that the trial judge had misled the jury on the correct standard of proof.  The Alberta Court of Appeal unanimously rejected all but the last of these grounds.  With a dissenting opinion on the issue of whether the trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the appeal comes before this Court as of right pursuant tos. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.

        "Facts": " 3The relevant facts of this appeal are not in dispute.  The appellant is a woodsman and a labourer who lived with his mother in Belmont, Nova Scotia, near Truro.  At the time of the offence, he was 35 years old.  He had no prior criminal record.  He had a drinking problem from the age of 14 until his early 30s.  He stopped drinking when he entered a relationship with the victim’s sister, Anita Teed.  When they broke up, the appellant started drinking again.  4One such occasion was on May 14, 1996.  On that day, the appellant was drinking with his friend, Adrian Teed, and Mr. Teed’s father, Karl Staples, at the house of Mr. Teed’s mother, Essie.  The three men left the house together and travelled to the Teeds’ isolated camp in the woods.  There, the three continued to drink, and the appellant began taking prescription drugs, including Valium.  While Mr. Staples was inside the cabin, the appellant and Mr. Teed successfully cut off a length of a rifle barrel.  The appellant told Mr. Teed that the gun was to be used to commit a robbery, but alleges that, in fact, he had intended to kill himself with the weapon.  The appellant testified that he wanted to commit suicide as a result of severe depression from a recent breakup with Mr. Teed’s sister, Anita.  The trial judge accepted that, at the time, the appellant was quite distraught.  It was also accepted that he was very intoxicated.  5While Mr. Teed remained at the camp, the appellant drove Mr. Staples home.  Upon returning to the camp, the appellant found Mr. Teed lying in the top bunk in the cabin.  While holding the rifle which he knew to be loaded, the appellant jumped up to the lower bunk in order to shake Mr. Teed – either to awaken him, or to get his attention.  As might be expected in this state of intoxication, the appellant lost his footing while he jumped, and he fell.  The gun discharged, and the bullet struck Mr. Teed in the head, killing him instantly.  The gun was not susceptible to shock discharge.  There was no evidence that the appellant intended to aim the gun at the victim.  6The appellant dragged Mr. Teed’s body out of the cabin to a point in the woods approximately five kilometres away from the cabin, and covered it with a blanket.  The appellant then drove to Essie Teed’s house.  He pointed the gun at Mr. Teed’s mother, telling her to be quiet and to sit down.  He told her he had already killed one person that night.  Mrs. Teed calmed the appellant down, and took the rifle from him.  The appellant stated that he wanted to kill himself.  In order to calm the appellant down further, Mrs. Teed took the accused to see the victim’s sister, Anita Teed.  7After this meeting, Essie Teed returned the rifle to the appellant, and told him to not bring it around anymore.  The appellant disposed of the rifle in a river.  The following day, he allegedly attempted to commit suicide by setting the cabin on fire while remaining inside.  Forty-five minutes later, he admitted himself into the psychiatric ward of a local hospital, where he confessed to killing Mr. Teed.  The appellant has always been very remorseful.  At trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death, contrary tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46, and unlawfully pointing a firearm, contrary to s. 86 of theCode.  8Both Anita Teed and Essie Teed feared for their safety after the incident, and this formed the basis of the probation officer’s pre-sentencing report recommendation that community supervision would be inappropriate.  The appellant spent five months in pre-trial custody.  At his sentencing, the appellant challenged the constitutional validity of the minimum sentence imposed pursuant tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code.  The trial judge found that the provision violateds. 12of theCharter, and sentenced the appellant to two years’ imprisonment for the criminal negligence charge (taking into account pre-trial custody), and one year consecutive for the unlawful pointing of a firearm charge.  The Crown appealed.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and imposed a four-year sentence on the appellant, without any credit for pre-trial custody.

C-46 , which provides judges with the discretion to count pre-sentencing custody in fixing the length of the sentence, may be applied to the mandatory minimum sentence of four years’ imprisonment for robbery while using a firearm under s. 344(a) of the Code.  I determined in Wust that a sentencing judge may give credit for time served in pre-sentencing custody, even if that credit results in a sentence below the mandatory minimum, since this reflects the intention of Parliament that all sentences be administered consistently within the context of the criminal justice system’s sentencing regime.",

Ct. J. relied on R. v. Brown (1976), 36 C.R.N.S. 246 (Ont. Co. Ct.), for the proposition that a general statutory provision yields to an express provision.  Thus, Ehrcke Prov. Ct.

Because s. 719(1)  of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 721(1)) provides that a sentence begins when it is imposed, McEachern C.J.B.C. held that it was not possible to reduce a sentence to account for time served while awaiting sentence, if such a discount results in a sentence of less than the required minimum.  Thus, in the appellant’s case there was no variation in the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge and his appeal was dismissed.",

C-46.  On October 16, 1995, he was released on his own recognizance which required that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour for twelve months and that he not initiate any contact or communication with the alleged assault victims.  The appellant was subsequently charged with breach of the condition that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  He was detained in custody on November 22, 1995, and subsequently appeared in the Provincial Court of Newfoundland, Youth Court Division, on November 23, 1995 at which time the matter was put over to January 4, 1996 for the purpose of entering a plea.  Eventually, despite several adjournments, the Crown did not present any evidence and the charges were dismissed.  3The appellant’s complaint relates to the distribution of the Youth Court docket for January 4, 1996 to two school boards in the City of St. John’s.  The docket was sent to the school psychologists who treated the information contained in the docket in accordance with the scheme set out in s. 38(1.14) and (1.15).  Other persons within the school system were only informed on a need-to-know basis.  The point, however, is that the distribution clearly wasnotlimited to the one school board that was responsible for a school attended by each of the young people on the docket.  A board does not have a cognizable interest in students or non-students for whom it has no responsibility whatsoever.  4The routine distribution of the Youth Court docket was undertaken by the Youth Court staff on the recommendation of its “Youth Justice Concerns Committee”.  This Committee includes representatives from Legal Aid, the Crown Attorney’s office, the Department of Health -- Mental Health Division, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, the RCMP, youth corrections, school boards, child welfare, and, occasionally, the Federation of School Boards and Trustees.  The Committee is, as its name suggests, a purely advisory body with no statutory powers or duties.  Although a Youth Court judge is a member of the Committee, it is common ground that when sitting on the Committee he is not exercising his powers as a Youth Court judge.

        "Facts": " 2The respondent’s family situation is complex.  Between February 1, 1995 and May 19, 1995, he had custody of W. and L., two children between three and five years old.  The respondent testified that at the time of the events, he was living with his current wife and her son.  Because W. and L. did not get along well with his wife’s son, the respondent had rented an apartment for them where they lived with a female friend, who looked after them at nights and during the weekends, and a babysitter who came in on weekdays.  The respondent visited the apartment on a daily basis, took about half of his meals there and was often present during the weekends.  3On May 9, 1995, a child and youth protection centre received information alleging that L. had been sexually abused by the respondent.  About a week later, the two children were removed from the respondent’s custody and placed in a foster home.  The foster mother did not know the respondent nor did she know why the children had been removed from his custody.  She and her sister testified against the respondent at the trial.  1.Statements by the Children 4The foster mother testified that:  (i)  While giving a bath to the two children, she observed them rubbing their penises together.  W. then started to hit L.’s buttock with his penis.  On being questioned, the children said it was “Papi” who showed them to do that.  (ii)  Another time, W. told her that “Papi” had rubbed his “coulout” on his body, had [translation] “wet his hair”, and that “when papi finished doing that . . . he put hiscouloutin his behind”, and that when he had done doing that, there was blood in W’s excrement.  W. told her that this was painful and caused him to walk with difficulty.  According to the foster mother, W. had tears in his eyes when he gave this account.  “Coulout” is a slang word for penis.  The foster mother said she had never heard the word until the child mentioned it.  5The sister of the foster mother also did not know the respondent.  She testified that at one point she was watching television with the children.  During an episode in which two persons were kissing, W. blurted out a similar “coulot” story with the same details about blood and difficulties in walking.  W. said that “Papi” would then clean up the excrement with some paper and that “Papi’s” “coulout” is quite different than his:  [translation] “it's bigger and all hairy”.  6On October 24, 1995, Sergeant Binette asked W. who had put his “coulout” in his buttock.  The child answered “Papi J.” and quickly identified the respondent as “Papi J.” when presented with pictures.  2.The Charges  7The respondent was charged with sexual offences in relation to both W. and L., including touching for a sexual purpose the body of a person under the age of 14 years, unlawful anal intercourse, and sexual assault.  3.The Examining Physicians  8Dr. Desmarchais, a pediatrist retained by the Crown, examined W. on July 24, 1995, more than two months after the children were removed from the respondent’s custody.  She observed a 1.5 cm lesion near the anus and thought that there was no doubt that the boy had been sodomized.  On the other hand, Dr. Chabot, also a pediatrist who testified for the Crown, was equivocal.  He examined W. on August 31, 1995.  He said that while the scar was longer than one might expect from constipation, the injury was consistent with constipation as well as with sodomy.  4.The Excluded Evidence  9In the course of his trial, the respondent tendered the evidence of Dr. Édouard Beltrami, a qualified psychiatrist who works extensively in the field of clinical psychology.  Dr. Beltrami’s evidence was tendered to establish that in all probability a serious sexual deviant had inflicted anal intercourse on two children of that age, and no such deviant personality traits were disclosed in Dr. Beltrami’s testing of the respondent.  The Crown objected to the admission of this evidence and avoir direwas held.  Dr. Beltrami testified in thevoir direas follows:  (1)  While it is not possible to establish a standard profile of individuals with a disposition to sodomize young children, such individuals [translation] “frequently” or “habitually” exhibited certain distinctive characteristics which could be identified.  The respondent had been tested for these characteristics and excluded.  (2)  The tests, which had been administered by Dr. Beltrami’s assistant, but the results evaluated by Dr. Beltrami himself, consisted of two approaches, the first a series of general personality tests, and the second a test which Dr. Beltrami considered could detect individuals with serious sexual disorders.  10In the first set of tests, the respondent was asked a series of questions about his family history, his schooling, his work experiences, his emotional and sexual life, his hobbies and life habits.  The “Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Test Version 2” (hereinafter “MMPI2”) was also administered.  The respondent’s reactions, while being questioned, were monitored by electromyography (EMG), which measures anxiety.  It acts as a sort of lie detector.  The objective of the MMPI2 is to identify different potential personality characteristics, including the tendency to be truthful, to hide symptoms, to be subject to psychosis, to be depressive, to be hyperactive, to be anxious, to be histrionic, etc.  These tests are not designed specifically for the detection of sexual disorders.  11The second and more controversial test was directed to the respondent’s sexual preferences.  It consisted of exposing him to images and sounds of sexual activity, both normal and deviant, and measuring his physiological reaction through a gauge attached to his penis.  The “strain gauge” is designed to pick up signs of physical arousal.  Dr. Beltrami explained that if the subject has previously derived pleasure from a specific form of sexual activity, the pleasure is imprinted on the brain, and may be restimulated on further exposure to pictures or sounds of similar activity.  This is how he explained it to the court:  [translation]  Q.   How do you . . . how is it done?  A.   The subject is shown normal and deviant images and is played normal and deviant audio cassettes.  Q.   Yes.  A.   And those who have derived pleasure in the past from a deviant sexual activity, this . . .  Q.   This test?  A.   . . . this pleasure is kind of ingrained in his brain in the form of an engram, to use the technical term . . .  Q.   Okay, just to . . .  A.   And when the subject is shown the same situations, it will cause either a mini-erection of which he is sometimes not aware, but a tumescence, that is, a swelling of his penis that is measured with a device for that purpose that is connected to electronic instruments that take down the resulting measurements.   12All of the tests used standardized questions, images and scenarios.  The respondent was never confronted with specific images designed to replicate the offences alleged against him.  13Dr. Beltrami testified on thevoir direthat the first set of tests showed that the respondent had had an unexceptional childhood, that he had not been sexually abused, that he had a good education which allowed him to hold a responsible job and that he was ingenious and entrepreneurial.  He noted that the respondent often maintained two or three intimate heterosexual relationships at the same time without his partners knowing about one another.  There were several children from these various relationships.  Dr. Beltrami notes [translation] “He clearly exhibits judgment problems in his tumultuous emotional life.  On the other hand, he does not seem to have the irrational ideas associated with sexual offences.”  Dr.  Beltrami noted a tendency on the part of the respondent to deceive, but apart from some emotional instability with women, Dr. Beltrami concluded that the respondent did not have any particular pathologies.  14With respect to the plethysmograph test, Dr. Beltrami concluded that the respondent has [translation] “a clearly normal profile with a preference for adult women and a slight attraction to adolescents.  He exhibits no deviation in respect of boys in general or prepubescent boys”.  15The trial judge ruled Dr. Beltrami’s evidence inadmissible.  He acquitted the respondent of the charges related to L. but convicted the respondent ofhaving, for a sexual purpose, invited, counseled or incited W. to touch the body of the respondent, (s. 152of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46) and having engaged in an act of anal intercourse (s. 159(1)of theCriminal Code).The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment of two years on each charge, to be served concurrently.  The majority of the Court of Appeal, Robert J.A. dissenting, found that Dr. Beltrami’s evidence ought to have been admitted, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

        "Facts": " 2The respondent Marijana Ruzic was born in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia.  She was 21 years old when she entered Canada.  When heroin was discovered on her, she was charged with three offences, two of which proceeded to trial:  possession and use of a false passport contrary tos. 368of theCriminal Code, and unlawful importation of a narcotic contrary to s. 5(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-1.  3Ms. Ruzic admitted having committed both offences but claimed that she was then acting under duress and should thus be relieved from any criminal liability.  She testified that, two months before her arrival in Canada, a man named Mirko Mirkovic approached her while she was walking her dog in the streets of Belgrade, where she lived in an apartment with her mother.  She described him as a “warrior” and believed he was paid to kill people in the war.  An expert witness testified at trial that, in 1994, large paramilitary groups roamed Belgrade and engaged in criminal and mafia-like activities.  The same expert maintained that people living in Belgrade during that period did not feel safe.  They believed the police could not be trusted.  There was a real sense that the rule of law had broken down.  4From there began a series of encounters between Mirkovic and the respondent while she was walking her dog.  Each time he approached her, he knew more about her, although she had shared no details of her life with him.  He phoned her at home.  He told her he knew her every move.  Ms. Ruzic alleged that his behaviour became more and more intimidating, escalating to threats and acts of physical violence.  On one occasion, he burned her arm with a lighter.  On another, he stuck a syringe into her arm and injected her with a substance that smelled like heroin and made her nauseous.  She indicated that these physical assaults were coupled with sexual harassment and finally threats against her mother.  5On April 25, 1994, Mirkovic phoned the respondent and instructed her to pack a bag and meet him at a hotel in central Belgrade.  Once there, he allegedly strapped three packages of heroin to her body and indicated that she was to take them to a restaurant in Toronto.  He gave her the false passport, a bus ticket from Belgrade to Budapest and some money.  He told her to fly from Budapest to Athens, and then from Athens to Toronto.  When she protested, he warned her that, if she failed to comply, he would harm her mother.  6Ms. Ruzic arrived in Budapest on April 26.  Late that evening, she boarded a plane to Athens, where she arrived early the next day.  She then purchased a ticket to Toronto.  She missed that flight, exchanged her ticket for the next available flight, and left for Toronto two days later, on April 29.  7During the two months prior to her journey to Canada, Ms. Ruzic testified that she did not tell her mother or anyone else about Mirkovic.  She was afraid he would harm whoever she told.  She did not seek police protection because she believed the police in Belgrade were corrupt and would do nothing to assist her.  She maintained that she followed Mirkovic’s instructions out of fear for her mother’s safety.  She made no attempt while in Budapest or Athens to seek the assistance of police or other government officials.  Similarly, before her arrest, she did not ask any Canadian authorities for help.  She asserted that she believed the only way she could protect her mother was to obey Mirkovic’s orders.

        "Facts": " 6The appellant, Robert Latimer, farmed in Wilkie, Saskatchewan.  His 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, suffered a severe form of cerebral palsy.  She was quadriplegic and her physical condition rendered her immobile.  She was bedridden for much of the time.  Her condition was a permanent one, caused by neurological damage at the time of her birth.  Tracy was said to have the mental capacity of a four-month-old baby, and she could communicate only by means of facial expressions, laughter and crying.   She was completely dependent on others for her care.  Tracy suffered seizures despite the medication she took.  It was thought she experienced a great deal of pain, and the pain could not be reduced by medication since the pain medication conflicted with her anti-epileptic medication and her difficulty in swallowing.  Tracy experienced five to six seizures daily.   She had to be spoon-fed, and her lack of nutrients caused weight loss.  7There was evidence that Tracy could have been fed with a feeding tube into her stomach, an option that would have improved her nutrition and health, and that might also have allowed for more effective pain medication to be administered.  The Latimers rejected the feeding-tube option as being intrusive and as representing the first step on a path to preserving Tracy’s life artificially.  8Tracy had a serious disability, but she was not terminally ill.  Her doctors anticipated that she would have to undergo repeated surgeries, her breathing difficulties had increased, but her life was not in its final stages.  9Tracy enjoyed music, bonfires, being with her family and the circus.  She liked to play music on a radio, which she could use with a special button.  Tracy could apparently recognize family members and she would express joy at seeing them.  Tracy also loved being rocked gently by her parents.  10Tracy underwent numerous surgeries in her short lifetime.  In 1990, surgery tried to balance the muscles around her pelvis.  In 1992, it was used to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back.  11Like the majority of totally involved, quadriparetic children with cerebral palsy, Tracy had developed scoliosis, an abnormal curvature and rotation in the back, necessitating surgery to implant metal rods to support her spine.  While it was a successful procedure, further problems developed in Tracy’s right hip:  it became dislocated and caused her considerable pain.  12Tracy was scheduled to undergo further surgery on November 19, 1993.  This was to deal with her dislocated hip and, it was hoped, to lessen her constant pain.  The procedure involved removing her upper thigh bone, which would leave her lower leg loose without any connecting bone; it would be held in place only by muscle and tissue.  The anticipated recovery period for this surgery was one year.  13The Latimers were told that this procedure would cause pain, and the doctors involved suggested that further surgery would be required in the future to relieve the pain emanating from various joints in Tracy’s body.  According to the appellant’s wife, Laura Latimer, further surgery was perceived as mutilation.  As a result, Robert Latimer formed the view that his daughter’s life was not worth living.  14In the weeks leading up to Tracy’s death, the Latimers looked into the option of placing Tracy in a group home in North Battleford.  She had lived there between July and October of 1993, just prior to her death, while her mother was pregnant.  The Latimers applied to place Tracy in the home in October, but later concluded they were not interested in permanently placing her in that home at that time.  15On October 12, 1993, after learning that the doctors wished to perform this additional surgery, the appellant decided to take his daughter’s life.  On Sunday, October 24, 1993, while his wife and Tracy’s siblings were at church, Robert Latimer carried Tracy to his pickup truck, seated her in the cab, and inserted a hose from the truck’s exhaust pipe into the cab.  She died from the carbon monoxide.  16The police conducted an autopsy and discovered carbon monoxide in her blood.  The appellant at first maintained that Tracy simply passed away in her sleep.  He later confessed to having taken her life, and gave a statement to the investigating police and partially re-enacted his actions on videotape.  Mr. Latimer also told police that he had considered giving Tracy an overdose of Valium, or “shooting her in the head”.  17Mr. Latimer has been convicted of murder twice in this case.  He was initially charged with first degree murder and convicted by a jury of second degree murder.  The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan upheld his conviction and life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years, with Bayda C.J.S. dissenting on the sentence:R. v. Latimer(1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (“Latimer (No. 1)”).  The case was then appealed to this Court:  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217.  It turned out that the prosecutor had interfered with the jury selection process.  The Crown conceded that a new trial could not be avoided.  In the second trial, Mr. Latimer was again convicted of second degree murder, and it is from that conviction that this appeal arises.

        "Facts": " 2In October 1970, Quebec was shaken by a serious political crisis.  Richard Therrien was then a minor and a first-year law student in the Université de Montréal law faculty.  He lived close to the faculty in his sister Colette’s apartment on Queen Mary Road.  Neither the brother nor the sister was at that time formally a member of the Front de libération du Québec (“F.L.Q.”), an association declared to be unlawful by s. 3 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970, SOR/70-444, enacted under theWar Measures Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 288. Richard Therrien’s sister was, however, a friend of Jacques Rose.  From October 17 to November 6, 1970, Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard and Bernard Lortie, the four F.L.Q. members associated with the kidnapping of the minister Pierre Laporte, hid in that apartment.  Richard Therrien’s involvement in these events was quite minor: he stayed in the apartment with them for only a few nights, preferring to keep his distance.  At one point, he went to get materials so that they could build a hideout, and at another time he mailed three letters at the request of one of these persons.  3On November 26, 1970, Richard Therrien was charged with illegally and unlawfully giving assistance to these four individuals with intent thereby to prevent, hinder and interfere with their apprehension, trial or punishment, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that they were members of the unlawful association, contrary to s. 5 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970.  He was also charged with communicating statements on behalf of the said association, contrary to s. 4(c) of the Regulations.  On April 14, 1971, he pleaded guilty and on the following day Judge Antonio Lamer, then of the Superior Court (Criminal Division), sentenced him to imprisonment for one year.  4After serving his sentence, Richard Therrien continued his legal studies and received his licence.  In the spring of 1974, the examining committee of the Barreau du Québec, which was established to consider the appellant’s candidacy in view of the fact that he had a criminal record, recommended that he be admitted to the professional school of the Barreau.  His name was first entered on the Roll of the order on January 26, 1976. From 1976 to 1996, he practised law in various provincial legal aid offices in a competent and dignified manner, thus winning the respect of his colleagues and members of the bench.  5On August 20, 1987, on the appellant’s application, the Governor in Council granted him a pardon pursuant tos. 5(b) of theCriminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 12 (1st Supp.).  The document he received stated that it is evidence that he was of good behaviour and that the conviction in respect of which it is granted should no longer reflect adversely on his character.  It also stated that the pardon granted vacates the conviction and removes any disqualification to which the person so convicted is subject by virtue of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or a regulation made thereunder.  6Between 1989 and 1996, Mr. Therrien submitted his candidacy in five selection procedures for judicial appointments.  He was interviewed on four occasions by the committee for the selection of persons qualified for appointment as judges, and on each occasion committee members raised the issue of trouble with the law.  In 1991 and 1993, he revealed his previous conviction and stated that he had been pardoned.  His candidacy for the first two appointments was unsuccessful, and it appears clearly from the evidence of persons who were selection committee members at that time that his criminal record was a determining factor in the decision to reject his candidacy.  It is not clear whether the issue was directly addressed at the third interview, but there is no doubt that during the last selection process he did not disclose his criminal record or the fact that he had been pardoned, when he was asked the following series of questions:  [translation] “Have you ever been in trouble with the law or with the Barreau?  Has any disciplinary action ever been taken against you?  Are there any outstanding complaints against you?”  Judge Therrien testified to the committee of inquiry of the Conseil de la magistrature that he felt he was justified in answering “no” to these questions for two reasons.  First, he understood, at the time, that the pardon had vacated his conviction and that this was precisely what the law meant.  Second, his answer meant that he would be assessed on his personal qualities and merits, although he was convinced that the Minister of Justice would be informed about his record.  7On September 18, 1996, as a result of the favourable recommendation of the committee for the selection of persons qualified for appointment as judges, and after running checks with the Barreau du Québec and the Sûreté du Québec and confirming that his record was clear, the Minister of Justice recommended that Richard Therrien be appointed as a Judge of the Court of Québec.  In late October 1996, the Associate Chief Judge of the Court of Québec and chairman of the selection committee which had recommended Judge Therrien for appointment, Louise Provost, learned that he had been in trouble with the law in the early 1970s.  She advised the Minister of the situation and stated that the appellant had failed to disclose this information to the committee.  On November 11, 1996, the Minister lodged a complaint with the Quebec Conseil de la magistrature pursuant to s. 263C.J.A., requesting that the Conseil [translation] “determine whether Judge Richard Therrien is capable, in the circumstances, of fulfilling his role with dignity, honour and impartiality”.  He also lodged a complaint with the Barreau du Québec; however, that complaint was stayed pending a decision by the Conseil.  8In accordance with ss. 268 and 269C.J.A., the Conseil de la magistrature established a committee of inquiry to consider the matter, and the committee submitted its report on July 11, 1997.  A majority of the committee, Judge Rivet dissenting, found that the complaint was justified and recommended that procedures for the removal of Judge Therrien be initiated in accordance with ss. 279(b) and 95C.J.A.  9On July 22, 1997, pursuant to the majority recommendation of the committee of inquiry, the Conseil de la magistrature recommended to the Minister of Justice that he initiate the process to remove Judge Therrien by making a request to the Court of Appeal in accordance with s. 95C.J.A.  The request was made on August 11, 1997.  Concurrently with that proceeding, on October 2, 1997, Judge Therrien filed an application for judicial review in the Superior Court, seeking to have the committee’s inquiry report and the recommendation and the order of the Conseil de la magistrature suspending him declared void and of no effect, and seeking to have the request to the Court of Appeal dismissed.  At the same time, he filed a motion for declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of s. 95C.J.A.  In response to the application and motion, the Minister of Justice filed two motions to dismiss in which he claimed that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to dispose of the issues in conducting the inquiry referred to it pursuant to s. 95C.J.A.  On January 26, 1998, Cliche J. of the Quebec Superior Court dismissed the motions to dismiss.  10The Minister of Justice appealed the decisions of the Superior Court to the Court of Appeal.  On May 14, 1998, a majority of that Court, Beauregard J.A. dissenting, allowed the first appeal and dismissed the application for judicial review filed by Judge Therrien.  The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the second appeal, and dismissed the motion for declaratory judgment filed by Judge Therrien.  11On October 28, 1998, the five judges of the Court of Appeal submitted a report to the Minister of Justice following their inquiry, in which they recommended that the Government revoke Judge Therrien’s commission.

        "Facts": " 3The prosecution’s case is that the accused, who was living with the complainant’s mother, sexually assaulted the complainant by making her touch his penis on numerous occasions in 1991 and 1992 when she was 5 to 6 years old.  The complainant told no one about these events for two and a half years.  In January 1995, the complainant had a conversation with a school friend about “gross” things, some of which were true and some of which were false.  During the conversation, the complainant told her friend about the assaults.  The friend reported the complainant’s disclosure to a teacher, and the matter was referred to the Children’s Aid Society.  A Society worker interviewed the complainant in the presence of a police officer.  The complainant first said that she could not remember any sexual touching, but later revealed incidents involving the accused.  The accused categorically denies the allegations.  4Charges were laid and the matter proceeded to trial.  At the time of the trial the complainant was 10 years old.  Defence counsel cross-examined the complainant on why she had waited so long to report the incidents and suggested that she had fabricated the story to “one up” the stories told by her friend.  In response, the Crown sought to call child psychologist Dr. Peter Marshall to rebut defence counsel’s submission that the lateness of the complainant’s disclosure supported an inference that she was not telling the truth when she said that the accused had sexually assaulted her. The trial judge called avoir direon the admissibility of Dr. Marshall’s evidence on this point.  5During thevoir dire, Dr. Marshall discussed delayed disclosure of child sexual abuse, based on his knowledge of the scientific literature in the area.  He testified that there are many factors which can affect the timing of a complaint, including the relationship between the child and the abuser and the nature of the abuse.  Some factors might discourage children from reporting abuse, such as embarrassment; fear of getting themselves or others into trouble; bribery or threats by the perpetrator; fear of being punished or sent away; disruption of the family; or fear that they would not be believed.  Young children might also not fully comprehend what happened or not see anything wrong with the abuse.  6Dr. Marshall also discussed the timing of allegations of abuse and its relevance to determining whether the abuse actually occurred.  In his opinion, most sexual abuse is never disclosed, so one cannot assume that disclosure normally happens immediately.  He testified that children disclose at various lengths of time after the event, so there is a continuum from immediate disclosure to delayed disclosure to no disclosure.  When cross-examined by defence counsel as to whether the profile of a victim of abuse could be developed by reference to the timing of the complaint, Dr. Marshall stated “the fact of the delay . . . doesn’t even enter into my thinking as to whether or not it happened....   [T]he research says that the length of time before a child reveals something is not diagnostic”.  The trial judge asked him to clarify what it means when delay is “not diagnostic”, to which Dr. Marshall responded  “[i]t proves nothing either way”.  7After Dr. Marshall testified, the trial judge asked defence counsel whether he took issue with Dr. Marshall’s opinion that a delay in disclosure is not diagnostic.  Defence counsel initially agreed that “the delay is provable of nothing”.  Crown counsel sought confirmation of that point, because “the whole tenor of [defence counsel’s] cross-examination of the complainant . . . was, If it happened you would have told somebody”.  Defence counsel then stated that he intended to indicate to the jury that “the fact that the victim did not tell anybody is certainly evidence that it didn’t happen to her”.

        "Facts": " 2The appellant’s argument of self-defence was based on an overwhelming fear of Jetté that he had developed over the course of their long and difficult relationship.  The record establishes that while Charlebois and the victim were sometimes friendly, Jetté dominated and regularly took advantage of the more dependent Charlebois.  The appellant’s unstable and violent childhood explains in part how Jetté was able to make him his [translation] “whipping boy”.  3The night of the murder, Jetté argued with his girlfriend and came over to Charlebois’ apartment.  Shortly thereafter, while the appellant’s neighbour Alain Lalancette was still present, Jetté flicked a knife in front of the accused’s face and said:[translation]“Yea, we’re going to have some fun tonight, you and me.”  4Charlebois testified that his apprehension grew after Lalancette departed, particularly when Jetté noticed that the appellant actually had in his possession a firearm that he had refused to sell to Jetté on the pretense that he no longer had it.  Nevertheless, Jetté said nothing about the rifle.  After the accused’s roommate came home, Jetté relaxed on the couch and told the appellant to go to sleep.  5The appellant testified that once in his bedroom, his panic became overwhelming.  He got up, took the rifle, approached Jetté and shot him in the back of the head while he was sleeping.  There was no argument, skirmish or threat.  Immediately after the shooting, the accused phoned 911 and made up the following story about a physical altercation:  [translation]  . . . I’ve just committed a murder . . . I was so afraid, I split. . . . [H]e was completely drunk when he came to my place. . . .  So, anyways, so he knew that I had a gun, then he took it, his girlfriend left him, so anyways, he was totally tripping, so I tried to convince him not to do anything stupid, then we started arguing, and the shot went off. . . .  I was really stoned eh so bang everything happened at once oh shit. . . .  When he was arrested, the accused said:  [translation] “I’ve done something stupid.” The jury found the accused guilty of murder in the second degree.  6On appeal, the accused challengedinter aliathe trial judge’s instructions to the jury on self-defence, the defence expert’s evidence, and the evidence of the appellant’s good character.  He also challenged the trial judge’s decision to allow the Crown to ask him in cross-examination whether he would undergo a blood test and submit to an examination by a Crown psychiatrist.  The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, Fish J.A. dissenting:  (1999), 135 C.C.C.

        "Facts": " 6J.W., the appellant's adopted daughter and complainant on each count in the indictment testified that the appellant began touching her in a sexual manner when she was 12 years old.  It happened, she said, on numerous occasions when he entered her bedroom, either at night, or at other times and in other locations when they were alone.  She further testified that the inappropriate conduct culminated in June 1984, when the appellant sexually assaulted her by having non-consensual sexual intercourse.  The complainant left home that day.  She first complained to the police about these incidents in 1994, when she was a mature and married woman and had lived away from home for over a decade.  7The “fresh” evidence to be considered on this appeal is an audio-taped conversation between J.W. and her mother, M.B., in which J.W. denied that she had been sexually molested by the appellant.  The recording was surreptitiously taped by M.B. in 1984, a few days after J.W.’s departure from home.  Ten years later, when the complainant brought her story to the police, M.B. gave the tape to the appellant’s lawyer.  The tape remained in his possession throughout the trial.  8Trial counsel chose not to introduce the tape in evidence.  Instead, he raised questions about the contents of the tape on cross-examination of the complainant who was not aware that the tape existed.  The complainant denied having had any contact with her mother, M.B., until about three months after she had left home permanently.  She had no specific recollection of the detailed conversation which was put to her in cross-examination at the trial.  9The appellant did not testify.  The appellant's spouse M.B. testified and contradicted the complainant's evidence about the conversation, which she said occurred shortly after the complainant left home.  She said that the complainant came with her boyfriend to collect her clothes and that the conversation occurred at that time.  During the conversation, M.B. attempted to find out why the complainant had left home.  Although at trial M.B. did not give a verbatim report of the questions and answers, she stated that she asked the complainant on several occasions whether the appellant had assaulted or molested her and, each time, the complainant denied having been assaulted in any manner.  According to M.B.'s testimony, the only reason the complainant gave for leaving home was her dislike of the strict rules she was required to follow.  10The complainant's sister, S.B., also testified.  While she did not confirm the discussion about a denial of any sexual impropriety, she confirmed her mother's evidence that the complainant returned home within a few days of leaving, and had a conversation with her mother in which she indicated that her reason for leaving was her dislike of the strict house rules.  11The jury acquitted the appellant of the most serious charge, sexual assault, which alleged forced intercourse to have occurred the day the complainant left home, and convicted the appellant of the other two charges.

        "Facts": " 31About 7:00 p.m. on July 15, 1994, the respondent drove to the Waterford Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in St. John’s, and was seen talking to a female resident of the hospital who then brought the complainant to his car.  James Barry, a psychiatric nursing assistant at the hospital, observed these events from a distance of about 200 feet.  He shouted at the respondent and the female resident but neither of them acknowledged the shouts.  Mr. Barry testified he saw the female resident grip the complainant, seat her in the car and lift her knees and shut the door.  He saw the respondent reach over the seat and lock the door.  The respondent was observed giving the female resident $20.  Mr. Barry reported the incident to his supervisors who called the police.  Despite a search effort it took over seven hours to find the complainant.  When she was found, both she and the respondent were still in the same car, now located in a remote coastal area at about 2:35 the next morning.  1.Complainant’s Physical Injuries  32The police arrested the respondent.  On driving the complainant back to the Waterford Hospital, the constable noted her shorts were on backwards, her underpants were hanging over the top of her shorts and she had bruises on her left cheek and left hand.  There were scratches on her arms and legs.  Subsequent examination did not disclose any semen or sperm on the complainant or on her clothes.  2.Complainant’s Out-of-Court Statements  33The complainant made statements to police at the time of her being found, as well as to the doctor who first examined her. She repeatedly pointed to her injuries and stated “Man did it, bad man, man in car, patient”.  Police also conducted a videotaped interview the following day.  She was questioned for 15 minutes in the presence of two nurses who had known and worked with her.  She was asked about the marks on her hands, arm and face to which, in halting broken sentences, she replied that a man “in handcuffs” did it and that he should be “put in jail”.  She said that it happened “last night” and that he was wearing glasses and a black hat.  She also communicated the facts that he scratched her in the car and that he smacked her.  3.Trial Evidence  34The case was tried by a judge sitting alone.  He heard from a number of fact witnesses, concluding with Ms. Marlene Miller, a psychiatric nurse at the Waterford Hospital who had known the complainant for about 10 years.  Latterly she was responsible for coordinating all of the complainant’s care.  She described the complainant’s personal habits, medications and mental abilities in some detail.  Of particular relevance are the following questions and answers:  Q.   What about her responsiveness to questions?  A.   She could respond, you know, like if you asked her if she was hungry, yes, but stuff like to get details, she didn’t give a lot of details of where she’d been or what she did, mostly only one sentence answers.  ...  Q.   Without getting into what was said, did you at any time, attempt to discuss with [the complainant] what had happened to her on that weekend?  A.   Yes.  Q.   Were you able to determine what had happened without getting into exactly what was said, were you able to–  A.   Yes.  Q.   Was that in the company of anybody else?  A.   I’m sure it probably was at times, there were actually a couple of times that she brought it up but it wasn’t like in a lot of detail, you know, it was just simple sentences but it left no doubt.  35At the conclusion of Nurse Miller’s testimony, defence counsel indicated that he would oppose aKhanapplication (R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531) to substitute the complainant’s out-of-court statements for her direct testimony.  His position was that the out-of-court statements were unreliable and theKhanprocedure was unnecessary in light of the complainant’s availability to testify in person.  4.The Voir Dire  36Crown counsel advised the court that the complainant had a mental disability and was “unable to communicate” within the meaning ofs. 16of theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.  Counsel also advised that she had earlier made out-of-court statements to a doctor and a police officer, some of which had been videotaped and all of which the Crown would apply to have admitted without calling the complainant.  The Crown called Dr. Francis Gillespie as its first witness on thevoir dire.  Dr. Gillespie is a psychiatrist who had been associated with the Waterford Hospital for 32 years.  The complainant was not his patient and he had never before “had any form of conversation with her”.  He interviewed her on one occasion a few days before trial “to assess her ability to give evidence in court”.  He concluded that she was “incoherent” about the matters in issue:  Q.   Did you attempt to question [the complainant] at all about the matter before the Court?  A.   Yes I did.  I asked her did a man take you from the hospital and do something to you and her response to that was totally incoherent.   37Dr. John Morley, a general practitioner who had known the complainant for about six years, had direct care of her at the Waterford Hospital for about one year prior to these events, and indirect supervision of her medical care for three or four years before that, had a different view.  A.   I think at that time she would have been - I don’t know how to put this - as well able to give a version of events as she would have been at any other time.  Q.   What about at this time, on today’s date, would she be able to give an account of what has happened last July?  A.   Possibly, but given her verbal limitations, it could be quite difficult to understand her, but I believe that she would be able to give some account, some account of what happened to her.  38Dr. Wanda Parsons, the family physician who had examined the complainant after the alleged assault testified:  Q.   Were her statements coherent?  A.   Yes.   39None of the doctors suggested that the complainant would suffer trauma or other adverse effects from appearing in court.  40Subsequently, the police officers were called in thevoir direto give evidence of the complainant’s out-of-court statements.  41The trial judge did not consider it necessary to have the complainant called.  He preferred the opinion of Dr. Gillespie and admitted the out-of-court statements.  The respondent was convicted of kidnapping, acquitted of sexual assault, but convicted of assault causing bodily harm.  He was sentenced to three years and nine months (after taking into account nine months of pre-trial custody).

C-46, s. 649 ).  I do not think that a discussion between the trial judge and two of the jurors 10 days after the conclusion of the trial, in the absence not only of the accused but of the other 10 jurors whose activities were also the subject matter of the discussion, is a disclosure “in open court” for these purposes."

        "Facts": " 40On February 13, 1998, after a trial before Madam Justice Keyser and a  jury, the appellant, Mohamed Ameerulla Khan, was convicted of the first degree murder of his wife, Sureta Khan.  This was his third trial.  Previous convictions had been set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal.  41The appellant claimed to have discovered his deceased wife in the bathtub of their home at 6:55 p.m. on January 4, 1994 and to have then telephoned 911.  The appellant’s call was transferred to a first responder who instructed him to leave his wife in the bathtub and drain the water, and that help would arrive very shortly.  Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.  42The Crown asserted that the appellant had killed his wife.  Its evidence was mainly circumstantial.  A pathologist, Dr. John Kelly Martin MacDonald, who was recognized as an expert in forensic pathology, testified for the Crown as to the possible circumstances of the death.  The Court of Appeal summarized Dr. MacDonald’s evidence in the following manner ((1999), 138 Man. R. (2d) 23, at para. 9):  Dr. MacDonald testified positively that the deceased did not die in the bathtub either by wet or dry drowning.  In his opinion, she died from asphyxiation, but in an unknown manner.  He estimated the time of death to be between two and four hours before the first responders observed her, which would fix the time of death to be between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  43Dr. MacDonald's opinion as to the time of death was based on the extent of rigor mortis found in the deceased's body by the first responders and on her core body temperature recorded at the hospital shortly after she was transported there at approximately 8:30 p.m.  44Dr. MacDonald’s opinion that the deceased did not die in the bathtub was based on the absence of “washerwoman changes or syndrome” on her body.  “Washerwoman syndrome” may be described as changes in the skin condition that result from being immersed in water.  According to Dr. MacDonald, if the deceased was in cool water, which would reduce the extent of washerwoman changes, he would not have expected the extent of rigor which was observed by the first responders.  45Dr. MacDonald further testified that in his opinion asphyxia or oxygen starvation was the cause of death.  Although the mode of asphyxiation was unclear, Dr. MacDonald was of the opinion that the death could not be classified as being of undetermined origin. Dr. MacDonald testified as follows:  I think her mode of asphyxia is undetermined.  If she was not discovered in the bathtub, I think the -- it may very well be an undetermined death, but given the fact that she was in the bathtub when the information that would argue that she has been dead at least a couple of hours and she does not have the washerwoman's changes, that she did not die in the bathtub, so I have great reluctance having the idea that natural deaths walk, let alone undetermined deaths walk.  I do not think I could classify this or not argue with someone who wished to classify this cause of death as undetermined.  46The appellant relied on a defence of alibi.  However, he did not testify during the trial.  Rather, evidence as to the appellant’s whereabouts on the day in question was provided by an acquaintance, Mr. Marshall Ross, and through the filing of two exhibits.  Mr. Ross indicated that the appellant arrived at his home at 3:40 p.m. in order to do some work on his daughter’s car.  He added that, at 4:01 p.m., the deceased called to speak to the appellant.  Finally, Mr. Ross stated that the appellant left his home at 5:00 p.m.  His recollection of the time of departure was an estimate based on the time he sat down for dinner and the time it would have taken his wife to prepare the meal from the time the appellant left.  Although Mr. Ross was a witness called by the Crown, counsel for the Crown, in his closing arguments, suggested that Mr. Ross’ recollection as to the time of departure was incorrect and that, in fact, the appellant left his residence earlier.  After the appellant left the Ross home, Mr. Ross heard from him a few minutes prior to 7:00 p.m., when the appellant called to tell him that his wife was lying in the bathtub and appeared not to be breathing.  The appellant then requested that Mr. Ross come over.  47Also presented into evidence was a receipt from an automated teller machine that confirms that the appellant received $60 from a machine at 5:33 p.m. on the relevant date.  The machine was located five minutes away from the appellant’s residence.  Moreover, the appellant produced a receipt from a pharmacy indicating that a prescription order was received at 5:44 p.m. and paid for at 6:35 p.m.  48The evidence also established that the deceased was heavily insured and that the appellant was the beneficiary.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant was the only person with access to the house, with a motive and with the opportunity to kill the deceased.  The theory of the defence was that the death was unexplained, that the autopsy was inconclusive and that there was insufficient evidence of foul play.  49During the course of its deliberations, the jury requested transcripts of Dr. MacDonald’s testimony.  Approximately six and a half hours after the transcripts  were delivered to the jury, it was discovered that the copy of the transcript given to the jury inadvertently contained the record of matters discussed by counsel and the Court in the absence of the jury during avoir dire.  As such matters should have been expunged, defence counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that the proceedings had become tainted and the trial was unfair.  The main objectionable passage reads as follows:  MR. GLAZER [Defence counsel]:  I beg to disagree, My Lady.  The law as I understand it is -- for example, My Lady had ruled that certain comments by the accused are inadmissible.  If the witness during the course of his testimony refers to those comments as forming the basis of some of his opinion, it would be grounds for a mistrial.  He can only refer to what is before the jury; he can't refer to evidence that is not before the jury.  50The defence argued that the jury had learned that the appellant had made comments that were ruled inadmissible.  In the defence’s view, the jury would speculate as to the nature of those comments and would draw an adverse inference against the appellant.  The trial judge denied the request for a mistrial.  She ordered, however, that the offending transcripts be retrieved and that the jury be provided with clean copies.  The trial judge further cautioned the jury that they were to rely solely on the evidence that was put before them through witnesses and through the evidence filed.  Once the jury returned a guilty verdict of first degree murder, the trial judge requested further submissions regarding the possibility of granting a mistrial.  After submissions by both counsel, the trial judge again declined to declare a mistrial.

        "Facts": " 6The respondent lived with the informant, Ms. Sandra Noseworthy, for about a year and a half in a relationship that, at least during its latter stages, can best be described as stormy.  He, for example, alleged that at one time she had thrown a beer glass at him and, at another time, had slashed at his knees with a hammer.  On one occasion, he said, he went to the RCMP “with my face busted open” and was advised, he says, “to get out of the relationship”.  The separation was not amicable, at least as described by the respondent:  So I got my friend Martin to come up with me and when I got up there she [Ms. Noseworthy] was kicking the . . . trying to kick the door in on my shed.  And I unlocked it and let her get her chair and Christmas stuff and ah, she give me a couple of punches in the face again then and threw a rock at me trying to beat the window out of my house and ah, beat the back window out of me truck, and ah, threw a stick and hit me in the face with it.  Just kept on going on and on like.   The respondent says that when he decided to go his own way, she threatened him saying, “I hope you live your life in misery.  If I have anything to do with it, you will.” At trial she testified that “Maybe I did say it.  Maybe I did.”  7During their year and a half together the respondent, then unemployed, had been renovating a house.  Two days after the break-up, Ms. Noseworthy went to the police to inform them that the respondent had a month or so previously confessed to stealing two windows from a local building supplies dealer.  Her description of the allegedly stolen goods, in its entirety, was “vinyl windows, two-pane.  They were the . . . they rolled out, one side”.  The local building supplies dealer was contacted.  Despite the lapse of time since the alleged theft, he was unaware of it.  He then checked his inventory and confirmed that two 40 x 36 inch vinyl windows were missing from a truck parked across the road from his shop, which was used for storage.  At the date the windows went missing, which is unknown, the truck contained 30 to 40 windows plus other building supplies, and was not kept under lock and key.  He testified that employees and passers-by had access to the area, and there had been no indication of forced entry.  Ms. Noseworthy testified that the respondent stole the windows “to use them in his house”, but in fact there was no evidence that the house had been searched or that “stolen” windows were incorporated in the structure or were otherwise located on the respondent’s property or, indeed, elsewhere.  8Other than the evidence of Ms. Sandra Noseworthy, there was no evidence connecting the respondent with the missing windows.  Ms. Noseworthy acknowledged that there were no identifying stickers on the windows when she saw them.  She said the respondent had admitted to her that he had scraped them off and burned them.  9All of this was vigorously denied by the respondent, who was 24 years old and had no criminal record, nor had he ever been charged with a criminal offence.

        "Facts": " A.Overview  3On March 15, 1995, Gerald Regan, by that time a former Premier of Nova Scotia, was charged with a long list of sexual offences, against a variety of women who had worked for or with him, dating back to the 1950s.  The stories of alleged abuse had taken a long and winding path before finally surfacing.  First, a CBC journalist spoke to a number of women who told of abusive acts they had allegedly suffered at the hands of the appellant.  But that journalist did not broadcast the story.  Several years later, while doing some research of his own, an avowed political foe of the appellant uncovered the information from the aborted news report.  This informant took the stories to the police in July of 1993, and in September, an RCMP task force launched an investigation.  During the investigation, a police officer responded to a reporter’s request to confirm or deny that the appellant was under investigation.  The police confirmed — a public admission which was in violation of police policy to remain silent about individual suspects until charges are laid.  More than 300 interviews later, and 18 months after the story first broke about the Regan investigation, charges were laid.  B.The Charges  4The decision to lay charges also has a convoluted history.  At the conclusion of the police investigation, a report dated March 30, 1994 was submitted to the province’s then Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”), John Pearson, with a request for his opinion about the laying of charges.  The report identified 22 women complainants.  Among them were six women who had been Regan’s babysitters, one who had been his housekeeper, a political intern, a legislative page, a secretary, and a political reporter.  The women were all young at the time of the alleged assaults, ranging in age from 14 to 24 years.  One woman alleged she was raped when she was 14, two others alleged attempted rape.  The other incidents involved sexual touching, exposure and kissing.  The police report categorized the charges this way:  -                  three complainants who “may have been victims of sexual impropriety”, but in the opinion of the police were not victims of criminal acts (although the acts showed a “modus operandi”);  -                  six complainants who the police believed were victims of criminal offences, but who were “not willing to testify in a court of law”;  -                  four complainants who were considered victims of criminal offences, but who did not want to testify as complainants, and were only willing to “co-operate by providing similar fact evidence at trial”;  -                  and nine complainants of criminal acts who were willing to testify as complainants.  Of these nine, one of them alleged the attack had occurred in Calgary, Alberta.  5DPP Pearson responded to police by letter dated June 28, 1994, that he and two other prosecutors had reviewed the file.  One of those was Susan Potts, then Senior Crown Attorney in charge of sexual assault prosecutions.  Pearson recommended that charges should be laid involving four of the eight Nova Scotia-based complainants who were willing to testify.  He chose the incidents which involved the most serious physical violations, including rape, attempted rape, and the one case where it was alleged the appellant had exposed his penis.  6In the other four local cases of willing complainants, DPP Pearson recommended that the police not proceed with charges.  These cases involved many similar accounts of the appellant trying to grope and “French kiss” the victim.  DPP Pearson explained that although these acts would have been against the law at the time, “the allegations are minor in nature, especially when placed in the context of societal values at the time”, and the “staleness” of the offences outweighed their “gravity”.  He thought that the minor charges could be sanctioned by proceeding against the more major ones, and he feared that otherwise the prosecution might appear to be a “persecution”.  7In addition, DPP Pearson advised that “the case against Regan would be significantly enhanced if some of the more recent incidents were proceeded with”.  He recommended that the police re-contact the six women who had been victims of apparent criminal conduct, but were unwilling to testify.  He made no recommendation about the complainants who had apparently been victims of criminal behaviour, but were only willing to give similar fact evidence.  Finally, DPP Pearson recommended that the police contact Alberta authorities with regard to the Calgary-based incident.  He advised the police that “you are not obliged to accept our opinion and that the final charging decision rests with you.  We are also cognizant of the duties and responsibilities of Crown Counsel to consider whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with charges once they have been laid.”  He suggested that police investigators “meet with [Crown counsel] Susan Potts to finalize the wording of any charge [the police] decide to proceed with”.  8The police did not agree with DPP Pearson’s charging recommendation.  They were of the view that a more complete picture of the allegations against the appellant should be put before the court.  Chief Superintendent Falkingham testified:  . . . over the several years I saw a pattern and an MO that Mr. Regan sexually assaulted, in my view, a number of young teenagers.  . . . The MO was with babysitters, the MO was with – when he had an opportunity to be alone with a young girl, and I felt that that was all building into a large picture which indicated to me that there was a continuing criminal offence in my mind, together – as a global investigation.  . . .  My view is the matter of charges had to involve the large number of complainants and as a result of them – the continued offences over the years. . . .  9After the Crown joined police in re-interviewing most of the original complainants, 16 counts for sex-related offences, involving 11 women, were laid against the appellant on March 15, 1995.  On May 30, 1995, a revised information was sworn, which added two new complainants and three new counts, for a total of 19 counts related to 13 women.  10The matter proceeded to a preliminary hearing in April 1996.  One year later, the Crown decided to prefer a direct indictment.  In that final charging decision, one complainant was dropped, a new one was added (count 16), and the charges concerning a third were amended to drop one count, bringing the final tally to 18 counts of sex-related offences, involving 13 women, laid against the appellant.  C.Crown Conduct  11After DPP Pearson’s written recommendations, Crown Potts met with police on July 15, 1994.  At that recorded meeting, Crown Potts suggested that it would not be “advisable” that charges be brought before a particular judge, because she thought he would have political ties to the appellant.  Instead, she said she would “keep monitoring the court docket to see who is sitting when and what would be in our best interest” – an exercise commonly known as “judge shopping”.  12At the same meeting, Potts requested to read all the investigation reports, because “this would give her a clear picture of what was actually going on”.  Notes of a meeting on January 17, 1995, attended by the RCMP Chief Superintendent on the case, confirmed that Potts had by then re-read “the evidence and the victims’ statements”.  Police and Crown then agreed that six complainants reluctant to testify “have to be re-interviewed”.  In the end, police and Crown counsel together re-interviewed many of the original 22 complainants, as well as five new women who came forward after the Pearson letter.  13The purpose of the re-interviews was “[f]irstly and primarily, to provide information about the Court process to potential complainants so that they could make an informed decision as to their involvement in these proceedings; and secondly, to make assessments of credibility about these witnesses, including their capacity for recall and general demeanor issues, and to prepare for a preliminary inquiry”.  (Trial submissions of the Crown, Appellant’s Record, p. 1089)  14The re-interviews included 16 of the original 22 complainants: four of the six reluctant witnesses whom DPP Pearson had recommended should be re-approached; three of the four women only willing, at first, to give similar fact evidence; three of the four complainants for whom Pearson had recommended laying charges (the fourth refused to proceed further); all four willing complainants whom the police wanted to charge but for whom DPP Pearson had recommended that no charge be laid; the complainant in the Alberta-based incident; and one of the three complainants for whom, at first, it was thought there was no criminal offence.  15Crown Potts was removed from the prosecution of this case by the time the preliminary inquiry began in April 1996.  Crown Adrian Reid stepped in as lead counsel at the preliminary inquiry and trial.  Crown Reid became involved with the case in December 1995 after charges were laid.  16Citing the cumulative effect of this Crown behaviour combined with the police premature identification of him as a suspect, the appellant sought a global stay of all of the charges.  At trial, a partial stay – 9 of the 18 counts – was granted.

            "3                                   At trial, Mr. Parent argued that the verdict should be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of lack of criminal intent or provocation.  The jury found him guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment, and a lifetime prohibition on possessing firearms, ammunition and explosives: [1997] Q.J. No. 4459 (QL).",
            "6                                   The jury had three possible offences before it: first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter.   All three offences require proof of an act of killing (actus reus) and the corresponding criminal intention (mens rea).  In relation to murder, the defence of  provocation does not eliminate the need for proof of intention to kill, but operates as an excuse that has the effect of reducing murder to manslaughter.",
            "7                                   The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in suggesting that anger is capable of negating the intention to kill and that the jury could reduce the offence to manslaughter on this basis.  More particularly, the Crown suggests that the judge’s directions wrongly treated anger as a matter that could negate the criminal intent or mens rea of the offence; wrongly suggested that negation of intent can reduce the offence to manslaughter; and wrongly left open the suggestion that anger alone can establish provocation, when in fact other requirements must be met pursuant to s. 232  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  The gravamen of the Crown’s submission is that the trial judge’s direction on intention was confusing and wrong and left it open to the jury to convict the accused of manslaughter, not on the basis of provocation (which the trial judge correctly defined), but on the erroneous basis that a high degree of anger short of provocation, as defined in law, could negate the criminal intent or mens rea of the offence.",
            "So, you must look at the accused’s state of mind when he killed Suzanne Bédard, you look at the entire evidence, including the elements surrounding the provocation defence with a view to determining whether he acted with the criminal intention that I defined earlier.",
            "9                                   The Crown argues that this passage creates a halfway house defence of anger, between non-mental disorder automatism and provocation.  I agree.  This passage  suggests that anger, if sufficiently serious or intense, but not amounting to the defence of provocation, may reduce murder to manslaughter.  It also suggests that anger, if sufficiently intense, may negate the criminal intention for murder.  These connected propositions are not legally correct.   Intense anger alone is insufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter.",
            "14                               The question, however, is whether the recharge on provocation corrected the earlier misdirection suggesting that anger short of provocation might suffice to reduce murder to manslaughter by raising a doubt on the existence of the criminal intent for murder.  Since the trial judge began his recharge on provocation by noting (correctly) that the jury must already have satisfied itself of the basic elements of murder before it got to this point – actus reus and mens rea – the recharge did not address the earlier erroneous suggestion that anger alone might reduce murder to manslaughter.",
            "15                               More seriously, the trial judge incorporated by reference into the recharge, his earlier erroneous charge on criminal intention.  He stated:",
            "[translation] I defined criminal intention in a general manner and I indicated to you that if you had a reasonable doubt with respect to the accused’s criminal intention, you had to return a verdict of manslaughter because the crime would no longer amount to murder.",
            "This incorporated into the trial judge’s recharge his previous erroneous comments suggesting that anger alone could negate criminal intention or mens rea and hence reduce murder to manslaughter.",
            "16                               I conclude that the recharge did not cure the errors in the trial judge’s initial direction on how anger could affect criminal intent.",
            "17                               The respondent argues that the fact that the jury asked for directions on provocation after they had deliberated for four days, combined with the trial judge’s direction that they could consider provocation only if they were satisfied of the basic requirements for murder, including criminal intention, suggest that the jury’s verdict of manslaughter must have been based on provocation, not the problematic direction on criminal intent.  Yet this conclusion is speculative. The fact remains that the jury may have come to its conclusion that the respondent was guilty of manslaughter by another route – the erroneous thesis that serious anger on its own can negate the  criminal intent required for murder.  The asking of a question related to one possible route to a verdict does not establish that the jury actually followed that route.  It is quite possible that the jury went back to the fundamental issues of criminal intent after hearing the judge’s recharge on provocation.  In view of the misleading directives on anger, we cannot be assured that the jury was able to carry out its function according to the law.  To put it another way, we cannot be sure that the recharge corrected the potential for the jury deciding on manslaughter on the erroneous basis put forward in the initial charge.",
            "18                               The trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on the effect of anger on criminal intent or mens rea and its relationship to manslaughter.  This error was not corrected on the recharge and we cannot infer from the way the trial proceeded that the jury’s verdict of manslaughter was not based on the erroneous initial direction.  It follows that the conviction for manslaughter must be set aside and a new trial directed.",
            "19                               As indicated earlier, the Crown in this appeal, relied solely on the trial judge’s misdirections on anger and criminal intent.  It is therefore unnecessary to comment further on the applicability of the defence of provocation as it may be tendered at the new trial.  It will be for the judge on the new trial to determine whether, on the evidence there presented, the defence of provocation should be put to the jury."

Professor Klinck,supra, writes at p. 15: “A common example of the obvious continuity of reality is colour: the colours of the spectrum shade into each other; different languages draw lines at different places.”  14In conclusion, I reiterate that the causation test inSmithersremains the law and to rephrase it in the language of a “significant contributing cause”, as my colleague suggests, would draw the line at a different place, thus drastically changing the law. I have found no legitimate reason to reformulate theSmitherstest, rather it is my opinion that such alteration should be strenuously proscribed since it will elevate the threshold of causation. As a result, Iconsider the current language of “a contributing cause [of death] that is not trivial or insignificant” to be the correct formulation that trial judges should use when expressing to the jury the standard of causation for all homicide offences.  15I would dismiss the appeal.

C-46 , which states that murder is first degree if the accused caused the death of another person “while committing or attempting to commit” an offence enumerated under that provision, requires that the victim of the murder and the victim of the enumerated offence be the same person.  For the following reasons, I conclude that the kind of error alleged by the appellant here is reviewable on certiorari, but that the preliminary inquiry judge did not err in finding that s. 231(5) may apply even where the victim of the murder and the victim of the enumerated offence are not the same.",
            "10                               The only issue at the preliminary inquiry was whether the accused could be committed to trial for first, rather than second, degree murder.  The Crown advanced two arguments.  First, it argued that the appellant could be committed on the basis of s. 231(5) (e) of the Criminal Code , which provides that murder is first degree if the accused murdered “while committing” an offence under s. 279  of the Criminal Code .  Section 279 covers offences of kidnapping and forcible confinement.  Second, the Crown argued that the appellant could be committed on the basis of s. 231(2), which states that murder is first degree “when it is planned and deliberate”.",
            "15                               Before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Crown argued that, even if the preliminary inquiry judge had erred in finding that s. 231(5) could apply where the victim of the murder and the victim of the enumerated offence are not the same, the error constituted an error within jurisdiction and accordingly was not reviewable on certiorari.  Finlayson J.A., writing for a unanimous panel, agreed.  In his view, the question was answered by this Court’s decision in Quebec (Attorney General) v. Girouard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 254 (hereinafter “Tremblay”), which he took to stand for the proposition that a preliminary inquiry judge’s error in interpreting the Criminal Code  is an error within jurisdiction and therefore unreviewable on certiorari.  Applying Tremblay, supra, Finlayson J.A. restored the order of Wake Prov. J. committing the accused to trial for first degree murder.",

        "Facts": " 2The appellant was charged with the first degree murder of John Whittaker.  He was also charged with the sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, forcible confinement, and robbery of the complainant, Janet Seccombe.  The appellant did not contest his committal to trial for all charges listed in the information except for the charge of first degree murder.  The only issue at the preliminary inquiry was whether he could be committed to trial for first degree murder rather than second.  3Seccombe’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry was to the following effect.  Seccombe met the appellant in 1992, while he was serving a jail term, and began a romantic relationship with him that continued after his release from jail in March of 1997.  When Seccombe first met the appellant, Whittaker had been a tenant in her home for approximately 18 years and was“like a brother”to her.  Whittaker and the appellant did not get along and were openly hostile toward one another.  Whenever the appellant visited Seccombe, Whittaker avoided him by going downstairs to the basement to work on his computer.  Whittaker indicated to Seccombe that he would move out if the appellant moved in.  Accordingly, the appellant did not move in with Seccombe after his release from jail.  Seccombe attributed the hostility between the appellant and Whittaker to the fact that the appellant is black and Whittaker was racist.  4The relationship between Seccombe and the appellant deteriorated, apparently because the appellant refused to make payments on a car that Seccombe had purchased on his behalf.  They had a disagreement on December 24, 1997.  On December 28, the appellant called Seccombe and she agreed to go to dinner and exchange Christmas gifts.  5The appellant arrived at Seccombe’s home at around 4:30 p.m. on December 28.  Whittaker was at home and in the basement.  There is no evidence that the appellant knew Whittaker was in the house.  After sharing a bottle of beer with Seccombe, drinking a shot of rum, and giving Seccombe two Christmas gifts, the appellant told Seccombe that he had also purchased a dress for her.  He asked her to go upstairs and put it on to wear to dinner.  Seccombe went upstairs, sat on her bed and started to undress.  6The appellant followed her into the bedroom, put his arm around her neck, and threatened her with a knife.  The appellant told her that he was in an“awful lot of trouble”and needed her car keys, credit card, and personal identification number (PIN).  The appellant tied her up on the bed with an extension cord and shoelaces and gagged her.  He then went downstairs, returned with a bottle of rum, undressed, untied Seccombe’s feet, and allegedly sexually assaulted her.  Afterward, he released Seccombe so that she could go to the bathroom.  The appellant then tied her up again, this time using a telephone cord.  He drank more rum, brought her a beer (removing the gag but threatening Seccombe with the knife), inserted a pornographic movie into the VCR, masturbated, and then again asked for Seccombe’s PIN and her daily withdrawal limit.  After Seccombe gave him the information, the appellant left the room.  7For five to ten minutes the house seemed “really quiet” before Seccombe suddenly heard Whittaker screaming “Oh, my God, oh, no, oh no”.  After ten to fifteen minutes, the appellant returned to the bedroom, out of breath, with water or sweat pouring down his face.  He wiped his knife on Seccombe’s night dress, which was on the bed.  The doorbell then began to ring continuously.  The appellant asked Seccombe if the neighbours were home; she indicated that she did not know.  The appellant left the bedroom.  Three to four minutes later, a female police officer entered Seccombe’s room and untied her.  8Seccombe’s neighbours testified that they heard a violent struggle taking place in the basement of Seccombe’s home.  After hearing Whittaker saying, “Stop, you’re going to kill me” or “You’re going to kill me”, they called the police, and an officer was dispatched at 7:14 p.m.  Officers arrived at 7:18 p.m.  9The appellant met police at the door with a large bump on his forehead.  Police found Whittaker in the basement beaten and stabbed to death.  He had approximately forty stab wounds from the chest upward on the front and back and had been beaten with a blunt instrument.  A wooden mallet was found on the floor near Whittaker’s body.  The knife was found upstairs in the hall.  Seccombe was found tied to the bed.  Upon his arrest at the scene, the appellant told the officers, “You guys better call an ambulance . . . because I stabbed him . . . he hit me with a hammer, so I stabbed him.” ",

        "Facts": " A.The Kabalarian Teaching  3The Kabalarians are a secretive society whose original philosophy seems to have been reduced by the appellant to a hodge-podge of spiritual fantasies (e.g., having sex with disembodied minds).  Kabalarians believe that enlightenment is reached through ascension by steps of consciousness.  Sexual experience, the appellant says, is a key way to progress to the next level.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the appellant preached that he, as the leader, could be instrumental in enabling young girls to reach these higher levels through sexual/spiritual contact with him.  The Kabalarian teaching was summarized in part by Donald J.A. in the British Columbia Court of Appeal (citing the appellant’s factum), as follows (at para. 18):  It is the duty of parents to teach their children to develop their minds.  Unbalanced minds continue after the death of a body and can be dangerous to living minds by becoming disembodied minds.  A living person who is in a negative state of mind is in danger of drawing from the plane of disembodied minds.  A person who is having a sexual problem could attract from the negative sexual plane of mind.  That person would then need a session to remove the disembodied mind through a medium.  This is referred to as “mental work” and could be performed by Mr. Parker [the founder of the Kabalarian philosophy and predecessor to the appellant] and later by [the appellant].   4Several of the complainants described the appellant’s statements in like terms:  he talked about relieving them of “a negative plane of mind”, helping the complainant to become a “medium”, assisting a complainant’s spiritual development to reach a higher plane of mind through him (since he was a “high spiritual being”), performing a “mental demonstration” (while engaged in physical sexual touching), being close to the “principle” (“universal consciousness”), developing the complainant into an “instrument” and reaching mental oneness through physical oneness.  The appellant told some of them during “mental demonstrations” that their negative or disembodied plane of mind revealed that they wanted to be raped.  5I should make it clear that the Kabalarian philosophy as such is not and never was on trial.  Its relevance to this case is only as background to the distinctive sexual embellishments apparently added by the appellant.  There was some evidence that these sexual embellishments were not part of Kabalarianism under the leadership of the appellant’s predecessor.  6The appellant cautioned his “pupils” that they shared a special relationship or bond with him and should not tell anyone else.  He suggested to some of the complainants that they were being subjected to sexual intercourse while they slept by the “minds” of dead priests.  Many of the complainants testified that since the appellant was the spiritual leader of the Kabalarians, they believed at the time that his purpose was spiritual and not for his own sexual gratification.  There was shock on the part of some when he used the word “fuck” because the Kabalarian philosophy did not permit swearing.  One testified that the appellant said his “sperm was spiritual [and] that it would not make [her] pregnant”.  B.The Complainants  7The 11 original complainants were divided into two groups by the defence for procedural purposes including assessing similar fact evidence, grouping similar defences, and the application for severance of the charges.

        "Facts": " 3The accused, Jacques Cinous, was charged with the first degree murder of a criminal accomplice, Michaelson Vancol (“Mike”), at a gas station in Montréal on the evening of February 3, 1994.  Despite his claim to having acted in self-defence, the accused was found guilty of second degree murder on October 21, 1995.  4The accused testified that he and a friend, Josue Laforest (“Kent”), had been involved in the theft and resale of computers since August 1993, an activity from which he earned approximately $5,000 per week.  Another accomplice, Yves Louis (“Ice”), and the victim were also involved in some of these thefts.  5Approximately one month before the killing, at the beginning of January 1994, the accused described an incident during which his gun disappeared.  According to the accused, one night that January, he, Ice and Mike went out to steal some computers.  The presence of a security guard and other employees on the targeted premises forced them to abandon the theft.  The accused testified that when he returned home that evening, he found that his gun was missing.  This was a 9-millimetre gun the accused said he had acquired some weeks after his release from jail, in April 1993, and had carried with him every day since.  Convinced that Mike had stolen the weapon, the accused said that he decided that from then on he would have no more contact with either Ice or Mike.  This gun has never resurfaced.  There is no evidence that it was stolen or that Mike in fact stole it.  It was not on Mike the night of the killing and is not alleged to have been involved in the events of that night.  6The accused testified that he spoke with Ice and Mike on the phone the day after the gun disappeared.  Since he wanted no more to do with them, he said he would leave the money he owed them with his cousin ($800 for each of them).  He also told them that there would be no more thefts because the police had him under surveillance.  The accused testified that Ice and Mike nevertheless called him every day, several times a day, and would show up at the door at unexpected times wanting to do thefts with him.  He also testified that four or five days after the gun went missing, he began to hear rumours that Mike and Ice wanted to kill him, and that he was warned by a friend to watch out for them.  He had his cousin, whom he lived with, block their phone calls.  He testified that he managed to avoid them for three weeks to a month, but, on cross-examination, admitted to some contact with them during that period.  7On the morning of February 3, 1994, at 7:00 a.m., Mike and Ice called the accused and asked him to participate in a computer theft.  The accused agreed to meet with them that evening at his apartment, at 7:00 p.m.; nevertheless, he claimed that he had no intention of going out to steal the computers and thought they might not even come.  That evening, Kent arrived at the accused’s apartment by 6:00 p.m., and Mike and Ice arrived at approximately 7:00 or 7:15 p.m.  The accused testified that Mike and Ice kept their jackets on and whispered to one another as they sat in his living room watching television.  The accused said he saw Ice constantly placing his hand inside his coat and that made him suspect the two were armed.  He asked, and they told him they were not armed.  He said that he decided to participate in the theft with them to see if they really intended to kill him, to find out whether or not the rumours were true.  8Although the accused described what had gone on as suspicious, he did not argue that coercion was used to obtain his consent to participate in this theft or any of the previous thefts.  There was no evidence led to indicate that Mike had previously assaulted the accused or threatened him in order to obtain his consent to participate in thefts, nor was there a suggestion that Mike had assaulted or threatened to assault the accused on any other occasion, for any reason.  9The four left the apartment and got into the accused’s van in order to drive to the location of the computer theft.  The accused said that he knew Mike and Ice wanted to kill him when he saw the gloves that they were wearing.  Ice was wearing different gloves than the ones he had arrived with at the apartment; he changed from leather to grey cloth gloves, and the accused thought it significant that he put these gloves on before entering the van.  The accused testified that Mike tarried in a nearby alley before coming to the van and got in wearing surgical latex gloves.  Neither of these gloves were the black woolen gloves that the accused said were kept in the glove compartment of the van for thefts.  Moreover, the surgical latex gloves Mike wore were the type of gloves that the accused said he associated with situations where bloodshed was expected and that he had twice before seen used on “burns” — attacks on criminals by other criminals.  10There was no evidence led to suggest that surgical latex gloves carried any particular significance as a gang practice in their case or in general, e.g. that their use would indicate (i) bloodshed (as opposed to preventing fingerprints from being left during a theft), and (ii) bloodshed that would be specifically directed against a co-criminal (a “burn”).  There was evidence that the surgical latex gloves had been stolen by Mike at an opportune moment from a hospital.  The accused said that he had seen them being worn by hit men in movies.  11In the van, Kent was sitting directly behind the accused, who was driving.  Ice was next to the accused in the front passenger seat, and Mike was behind Ice.  The accused testified that Ice avoided making eye contact with him and kept touching his jacket as if he had a gun.  The accused also said that no one spoke of the theft and in fact no one was speaking at all, things that were unusual on the way to a theft.  The accused also said that Mike snapped the surgical latex gloves he was wearing, once. Kent testified that there was normal talking and laughing on the way to the van and that the atmosphere in the van was relaxed.  12The accused admitted that no threats in the form of overt words or actions were made to him in the apartment, in the van or later at the gas station.  However, he said that he interpreted Ice’s hand inside his jacket as a threat.  13In his testimony, the accused said he was sure that he was going to be killed and that the shot would more than likely come from behind — from Mike.  However, since he was driving, he could not get to his own gun quickly enough, were anything to happen.  He said that he tried to drive along well-lit streets and avoid red lights so as to minimize the chance that Mike or Ice would kill him then and there.  He also said that he felt trapped.  He pulled into a populated and well-lit gas station“to release the pressure”and get himself out of this bad situation.  He exited the vehicle and headed towards the cashier cabin to get a bottle of windshield washer fluid. Unable to locate his own money, he returned to the van in order to ask Ice for $5 to pay for the fluid.  He went back to pay for the bottle, returned to the van, popped the hood of the van from the inside, poured the fluid in under the hood and brought the bottle around to the back of the van.  He opened the back door of the van,“saw [the] opportunity”, as he put it, pulled out his gun and shot Mike in the back of the head.  14The accused testified that this was an instinctive reaction to a situation of danger and, more specifically, that he felt like a bell was ringing in his head.  He said that it did not occur to him to run away or to call the police.  He mentioned in addition to this that the police would have required him to work as an informant in exchange for their help and that he should not have to run away and leave his van.  15When asked whether he felt scared at the gas station, the accused stated “scared in a sense, yes”.  He said that he did not feel safe there or that he was out of danger.  He said he felt like Ice and Mike were going to kill him, that they were just waiting for the right moment.  16The accused testified to chasing Ice after he shot Mike.  Ice fell to the ground, but the accused said he did not shoot him because the danger was gone and he was in control of the situation.  Ice fled.  The accused returned to the van which he and Kent tried to push.  These two ultimately also fled the scene, abandoning the van with the body inside.  No gun was found on Mike’s body, although he was carrying a knife.  The accused was arrested some time later.  17At trial, the judge allowed the defence of self-defence to be put to the jury.  The Court of Appeal held that the defence was not properly explained to the jury, both in terms of the explanation of the burden of proof in relation to the defence and the explanation of the defence itself.  18The appellant Crown concedes, as it did before the Court of Appeal, that errors in the charge were made, but asks this Court to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,to uphold the conviction on the basis that any errors in the directions on self-defence are immaterial since the accused’s claim to self-defence lacked any“air of reality”and should never have been put to the jury.  According to the Crown, no retrial is required since, without the defence, the verdict would necessarily have been the same:  the accused would have been convicted of murder.  19The accused responds by saying that there was an air of reality to the defence since this threshold test requires only“some”evidence in order for the defence to be put to the jury and the accused’s own testimony satisfies this requirement.  A retrial is necessary, according to the respondent, in order for the defence to be properly explained to the jurors who must assess whether or not they believe the accused’s claim to self-defence.

        ],
        "Facts": " 2The accused was charged with the first degree murder of Enio Mora, who was to all appearances his close friend.  At the preliminary hearing, the Crown’s case against the accused was entirely circumstantial.  The accused called two witnesses whose testimony was arguably exculpatory.  The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant committing the accused to trial.  3The Crown’s evidence was to the following effect.  Mora was found dead in the trunk of his Cadillac at about 4:00 p.m. on September 11th, 1996.  The Cadillac was parked on the north side of Teston Road, between Pine Valley Drive and Weston Road in the City of Vaughan, which is located north of Toronto.  Mora had been shot four times in the left temple at close range.  4The Crown presented no evidence purporting to establish when Mora’s Cadillac was first parked at the place it was discovered.  However, one witness testified that the car was not parked there when he passed the area at 10:45 a.m.  Several witnesses testified that they saw the car at around 2:00 p.m., or soon after.  5The principal evidence linking the accused to the crime consisted of a bundle of clothes discovered by the side of Pine Valley Drive by Onido Salerno, a local farmer.  On September 11th, Salerno was working outside on his farm, which is on Pine Valley Drive just south of Teston Road.  At about 2:00 p.m., Salerno saw a black or blue car, a Buick or Oldmobile with a chrome stripe along the side, stop on the road in front of him.  The driver and a passenger got out and left something in the ditch by the side of the road.  The two then got back in the car and drove off.  After the car had driven off, Salerno went to see what the men had left in the ditch.  He found a pair of beige pants, a shirt spotted with blood, a pair of shoes, and a full package of Freedent gum. Salerno later viewed photographs at the police station and identified the driver of the car he had seen to be someone other than the accused.  The Crown maintained that the man Salerno had seen was the accused.  6The Crown presented evidence as to the whereabouts of the deceased and the accused on the morning of September 11th.  Nick Nesci, a real estate broker and long-time acquaintance of the accused, stated that the accused had arrived at his office some time soon after 10:00 a.m.  One of Nesci’s clients, Nicola Galiffe, had a 10:00 a.m. appointment with Nesci and was already in the office.  Mora arrived at about 10:20 or 10:30 a.m, to follow up on an offer Nesci had made to get him a good price on an exercise treadmill.  Nesci left his office at about 11:00 a.m. for an appointment.  He left Galiffe, Mora, and the accused standing outside his office, “talking like old friends”.  That was the last he saw of them that day, and the last he saw of Mora.  7Galiffe was not called as a witness but he submitted a signed statement to the police stating that he, Mora, and the accused went for coffee after leaving Nesci’s office.  8Some time on the morning of September 11th, Mora paged Giancarlo Serpe, an acquaintance, to ask  him to meet for coffee at 11:30 a.m.  The two apparently met for coffee on a daily basis.  They met for about 20 minutes or half an hour.  In examination-in-chief, Serpe stated that Mora left the donut shop at about 11:30.  On cross-examination, he stated that it was about 12:00 noon.  In any event it seems he is the last witness to have seen Mora alive.  9The accused cooperated with the police investigation.  In the course of one interview, he stated that he had been in Mora’s car on September 10th.  The police therefore asked him to provide “elimination prints”; he agreed.  He also agreed to provide a buccal swab for D.N.A. testing.  10Forensic tests revealed that the D.N.A. profile taken from the collar of the shirt found by Onido Salerno matched that of the accused and that the blood on the shirt was Mora’s.  The accused was arrested on December 3rd and charged with first degree murder.  A packet of Freedent gum was found on his person.  The shirt the accused was wearing at the time of his arrest was about the same size as the shirt that Onido Salerno had found.  The pants were the same size.  From the accused’s residence, the police seized, among other things, several packages of Freedent gum, many pairs of shoes, many pairs of pants, several rounds of .22 calibre bullets, a .22 calibre rifle, and a double-barreled shotgun.  Many of the shoes and most of the pants were the same size as those that Onido Salerno had found on Pine Valley Drive.  The laces on some pairs of shoes were tied in double knots, as had been the laces on the pair of shoes that Onido Salerno had found.  According to an R.C.M.P. expert who examined several of the shoes, it was “highly probable” that the person who had worn the shoes that Onido Salerno had found was the same person who had worn the shoes found in the accused’s residence.  The accused’s car was seized on December 4th.  It was a blue, 1989, 4-door Buick Park Avenue, with a wide chrome strip along the bottom of the fenders and doors.  Inside the car, the police found, among other things, Freedent gum and a pair of boots.  11The police theorized that Mora had been murdered at a farm located at 10367 Weston Road.  The distance between the farm and the place Mora’s car was found could be traveled in slightly over a minute, driving at 65 kilometres per hour.  The farm is owned by Nicola DiLorenzo, for whom the accused had worked “a long time ago”.  DiLorenzo stated that he had never seen the accused at the farm.  However, the accused’s son has done work for DiLorenzo.  Soil samples taken from one of the barns matched soil found on Mora’s clothing and shoes as well as on the shoes found by Onido Salerno on Pine Valley Drive.  The police also found feathers and feather fragments similar to those found with Mora’s body, on the boots found in the accused’s car, and on the shirt and pants found by Salerno.  In a subsequent search, the police found four .22 calibre live rounds of ammunition, a .22 calibre shell case, and a .22 calibre ammunition container.  12The accused called witnesses whose testimony was arguably exculpatory.  Michael Fiorillo, the owner of the real estate company with which Nesci is employed, testified that he saw Galiffe, Mora, and the accused leave his premises at about 11:00 a.m.  He also stated that he saw Galiffe and the accused in the same parking lot between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m., but closer to 2:00 p.m.  At that time, the accused was getting into his car.  Galiffe was getting into his own car.  Carmelo Suppo, a travel agent and long-time friend of the accused, testified that the accused had visited her on September 11th between about 2:00 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.  No evidence was offered by the Crown or by the accused as to how long it would take to drive from the place the clothing was found on Pine Valley Drive to Mr. Fiorillo’s office or Ms. Suppo’s office.  The accused suggested, however, that the testimony of Fiorillo and Suppo was exculpatory as it suggested lack of opportunity.

        "Facts": " 3The late Basant Singh Dhaliwal arrived from India to live in Canada with his parents about a month before he was shot and killed.  He had been watching a volleyball tournament with a collection of new friends.  After the games a group of about 15 individuals were standing around socializing.  4A van, allegedly owned and driven by the respondent, Sukhminder Braich, approached the group shortly after 5 p.m. with its side door open.  When it drew abreast, a burst of gun fire, variously estimated at between “a few” to 12 seconds in duration swept the victim group, shooting on a low trajectory into the ground.  Basant Singh Dhaliwal, who happened to be kneeling, was killed instantly.  Three companions, Ajaib Biln, Amarjit Tatla and Jarnail Dhaliwal, were wounded in the legs.  Tatla’s thumb was also hit.  It was alleged that the respondent Ajmer Braich was the shooter.  The van then sped away.  Sukhminder Braich’s van was found in a Safeway parking lot, freshly cleaned inside and out, a few days later.  It had not been reported stolen.  The two respondents are brothers.  5The only alleged motive for the shooting was a scuffle a week previously between the alleged shooter, Ajmer Braich, and his circle of friends with Jarnail Dhaliwal, one of the victims, and his circle of friends in the Rotary Stadium area in Mission, B.C.  Witnesses testified that Jarnail Dhaliwal had slapped Ajmer Braich with an open hand.  The trial judge commented that “[t]he scuffle resulted in some torn shirts, hurt feelings, no apparent injuries.”  The participants on each occasion were largely acquainted with each other, and there was no evidence of previous bad blood.  The motive for the respondents to kill members of the victim group was, accordingly, rather weak.  A.The Identification Evidence  6The respondents were convicted primarily, if not exclusively, on the basis of eyewitness identification.  7In oral reasons for judgment, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Jarnail Dhaliwal (who, as stated, had delivered the slap) that Sukhminder Braich was the driver of the van.  He had known Sukhminder Braich for about 10 to 12 years and was looking directly at the slow-moving van when he was shot.  The trial judge also accepted the evidence of Sher Braich, who was described as a “leader of the victim group”, that Sukhminder Braich was the driver and Ajmer Braich was the shooter.  With respect to the evidence of Jarnail Dhaliwal and Sher Braich, the trial judge found:  Both of these men had an absolutely clear view on a clear day and, even in a brief span of time with a van moving very slowly past them, they were both very familiar with both of these defendants and I have no doubt, therefore, that their identification is the truth.   8A third eyewitness, Samshir Uppal, also purported to identify the shooter, but his evidence was rejected because of prior inconsistent statements to a newspaper that “we never even seen those people”.  The trial judge found some of the other evidence from members of the victim group to be similarly unreliable.  9Neither respondent testified at trial.  10The next-door neighbour of Sukhminder Braich observed him driving his van, a two-tone GMC minivan, licence FHX-769, between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. the day of the shooting.  Witnesses variously described the last three digits of the shooting van as 769, 789 or 679.  11With respect to the identification evidence accepted by the trial judge, McEachern C.J.B.C. said that  I have carefully examined the evidence, and I have re-weighed it to some extent.  In view of the very positive identifications made by the two key Crown witnesses, it cannot be said that there is not some evidence that supports the judge’s verdict.  I cannot say that upon a proper consideration of all of the evidence, no properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could convict.  ((2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 467, 2000 BCCA 184, at para. 52)   12The trial judge, noting the low trajectory of the line of fire, concluded that the respondents lacked themens reafor murder.  They were accordingly convicted of manslaughter.  They were also convicted of aggravated assault in relation to the other victims rather than attempted murder.  They were each sentenced to nine years in jail on the manslaughter count, with lesser sentences on the convictions for the non-fatal shootings to run concurrently.  B.Appellate Misgivings About the Identification Evidence  13The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge because while the latter had “mentionedsome of the troublesome matters, he did not seem to consider them to be of much, or any, significance” (para. 50 (emphasis in original)).  The troublesome matters included: ",

        "Facts": " 4The facts of these cases are not controversial, nor are they determinative.  Accordingly, all three matters can be briefly summarized as follows.  5InLavallee, the R.C.M.P. obtained a search warrant in the regular form and wording pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Codeon  January 16, 1996.  The search was to be executed on the following day at the law firm of Lavallee, Rackel & Heintz, in the City of Edmonton, targeting correspondence, estate files, trust records and other documents in relation to Mr. Andy Brent Polo, an individual suspected of money laundering and of being in possession of proceeds of crime.  When the R.C.M.P. arrived at the law firm to execute the warrant, a solicitor who was familiar with the documents in question claimed solicitor-client privilege.  The searching officers accordingly followed the procedure set out ins. 488.1of theCriminal Code: the documents were sealed in envelopes, summarily identified and taken into police custody.  The next day, January 18, 1996, counsel retained by the law firm moved in the Court of Queen’s Bench to fix a date and place for a judicial determination of privilege in reference to the seized documents in accordance with s. 488.1(3).  In April 1996, the law firm gave notice of a constitutional question, alleging the unconstitutionality ofs. 488.1of theCriminal Code.  The law firm and Mr. Polo also moved to quash the warrant but the application was denied in part by Dea J.:  (1997), 199 A.R. 21 (Q.B.).   In 1998,  Veit J. struck down s. 488.1 as unconstitutional:  (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Alta. Q.B.).  The appeal from that order was dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal for Alberta: (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 187.  6InWhite, a search warrant  was obtained to search the law offices of Raymond P. Whelan, including all storage facilities occupied by him at the law firm of White, Ottenheimer & Baker, in the City of St. John’s, Newfoundland.  The warrant authorized officers of Revenue Canada to search the premises for documents relating to Daley Brothers Ltd. and Mr. Terry Daley who were suspected of the offences described ins. 239(1)(a) and (d) of theIncome Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).  When the search was executed on June 30, 1998, a partner in the appellant law firm claimed solicitor-client privilege with respect to the targeted documents and, as a result, pursuant tos. 488.1of theCriminal Codeands. 232of theIncome Tax Act, the documents were sealed and taken into police custody.  On July 9, 1998, the law firm moved to set a date and time for the determination of privilege under boths. 488.1(3)of theCriminal Codeands. 232(4)of theIncome Tax Act.    On January 29, 1999, the appellants applied for a declaration thats. 488.1of theCriminal Codeands. 232of theIncome Tax Actare contrary tos.  8of theCanadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms. Halley J. of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, dismissed the application.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part, resorting to the remedial techniques of severance and reading-in to salvage the impugned section of theCriminal Code:  (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 28.  7InFink, a search warrant was executed at the law firm of Turkstra, Mazza Associates on February 8, 1999, in the City of Toronto, targeting documents relating to the appellant Jeffrey Fink who was suspected of various counts of fraud over $5,000.  As result of the claim of solicitor-client privilege made on behalf of the appellant by counsel, the search was carried out according to the procedure set out ins. 488.1of theCriminal Codeand the documents were taken into police custody.  On November 11, 1999, the appellant applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for an order declaring s. 488.1 to be inconsistent withs. 8of theCharter.  Dambrot J. dismissed the application:  (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 566.  Goudge J.A., for a unanimous court, allowed the appeal and declared s. 488.1 to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect:  (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 577. ",

            "5                                   The appellant appealed his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on several grounds, including that the trial judge erred in law by misdirecting the jury on the proper definition of reasonable doubt.  The Court of Appeal convened a special five-judge panel, and heard the case with two others, R. v. K. (K.) (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 35, 2000 BCCA 161, and R. v. Finley (2000), 134 B.C.A.C. 142, 2000 BCCA 160.   The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the errors alleged, unlike those made by the trial judge in Lifchus, supra, could not have misled the jury.  However, two judges dissented and found that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to give the term “reasonable doubt” its plain and natural meaning, and that this error was compounded by the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury that more than probable guilt was required for a conviction.  The appeal comes before this Court as of right pursuant to s. 691(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .",
            "7                                   With regard to the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown to demonstrate the accused’s criminal intent for attempted murder, the trial judge said:",
            "Before you can find that the accused had the necessary criminal intent, that he specifically intended to cause death, you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this intent is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from what you accept as the proven facts.  The question on this element is what did the accuse[d] in fact intend to be the result of what he did.  Is there any reasonable doubt that he intended to cause death.",
            "The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt”, is composed of words which are commonly used in everyday speech.  Yet, these words have a specific meaning in the legal context.  This special meaning of the words “reasonable doubt” may not correspond precisely to the meaning ordinarily attributed to them.  In criminal proceedings, where the liberty of the subject is at stake, it is of fundamental importance that jurors fully understand the nature of the burden of proof that the law requires them to apply.",
            "·      the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence;",

            "25                               In Avetysan, the jury was not told that “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” was a special legal concept with a specific meaning in the context of criminal law, and it was not told to acquit if it concluded the accused men were “probably guilty”.  Moreover, the jury was not instructed that the proper standard of proof was more than a balance of probabilities but less than absolute certainty.  These errors were compounded by the fact that the jury was improperly instructed in how to resolve contradictory versions of the events as required in W. (D.), supra.",
            "29                               In Russell, the trial judge provided the jury with an explanation of the words “beyond a reasonable doubt” that included a number of divergences from the Lifchus standard, including that the words are to be used “in their ordinary sense and not as a legal term having some special meaning”.  The trial judge also failed to expressly indicate that mere probable guilt was insufficient to support a criminal conviction.",
            "32                                Considering how case-specific the matter is, I see no reason for this Court to interfere when an appellate court has exercised its judgment in evaluating the substantial compliance of a pre-Lifchus jury charge with the principles expressed in that case.  When reviewing a pre-Lifchus reasonable doubt charge, there is no particular mistake or omission that will automatically constitute a reversible error in and of itself, nor is there an additional instruction that will immediately cure a particular shortcoming.  Ultimately, the focus must be on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the criminal standard of proof.",
            "33                               In the present case, there are two specific portions of the charge that, in my view, reaffirmed the proper criminal standard of proof and would have assisted the jury on that issue.  First and foremost, as this was a case where the accused had testified, the trial judge charged the jury in accordance with W. (D.), supra, and specifically informed the jury on how the issue of credibility applies to reasonable doubt.  The trial judge charged as follows:",
            "34                               The appellant has argued that the errors in this case, taken together, may create an impression in the mind of the jury that reasonable doubt is more akin to a civil than a criminal standard.  The trial judge expressly indicated that the standard was less than “absolute certainty”, but never warned the jury that probable guilt is insufficient, instead equating the concept of reasonable doubt with its plain and ordinary meaning.  However, although the charge does not expressly state that more than probable guilt is required, in my view the W. (D.) portion of the instructions served to reaffirm the high degree of proof required for a conviction in the mind of the jury.  As Cory J. notes in W. (D.), at p. 758:",
            "Where the majority of a charge complies with Lifchus principles and the trial judge has omitted to expressly indicate that more than “probable guilt” is required, it would not be reasonable to conclude that a juror, after having received additional instructions akin to those recommended in W. (D.), would remain under the impression that anything less than a proper criminal burden of proof could rest on the Crown.  Even where such an omission is made in conjunction with another error, such as defining reasonable doubt as having a plain and ordinary meaning, such shortcomings can be countered by other parts of the jury instructions that serve to make the proper definition of reasonable doubt more clear.",
            "35                            The substantial compliance of the trial judge’s charge to the jury in this case is further reinforced by accurate instructions on reasonable doubt as it pertains to circumstantial evidence, on which a portion of the Crown’s case ultimately rested.  The trial judge explained to the jury that, with regard to the required criminal intent and the circumstantial evidence presented to prove it, it “must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this intent is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from what you accept as the proven facts”.  Then, in reference to all the circumstantial evidence presented, the trial judge explained that “you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that where it is relied upon to support a guilty verdict the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts as you have found them to be”.  Again, as with the W. (D.) charge, it would seem that any concern that the jury may have applied a probable guilt standard disappears upon consideration of these instructions with regard to circumstantial evidence.",
            "42                               Unlike with some oft-repeated principles, it is not trite to say that in our justice system an accused person cannot be found guilty of a crime unless the charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  This high burden of proof borne by the prosecution is inextricably intertwined with the equally fundamental issue of the presumption of innocence (Lifchus, supra, at para. 27).  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is such a crucial element of our criminal law that it bears repeating.  Especially so because the concept of “reasonable doubt”, deceptively, appears simple.  It is not.  As Iacobucci J. eloquently put it in R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 2000 SCC 40, at para. 241:",
            "44                               In addition, the progeny of Lifchus, including Starr, R. v. Bisson, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 306, Avetysan, R. v. Beauchamp, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 720, 2000 SCC 54, and Russell, have pointed to another principle in the reasonable doubt jurisprudence:  that the explanation that criminal guilt is more than probable guilt is a basic element, and an essential, minimum standard among those listed in Lifchus.",
            "As was emphasized repeatedly in Lifchus and again in Bisson, a jury must be instructed that the standard of proof in a criminal trial is higher than the probability standard used in making everyday decisions and in civil trials.  Indeed, it is this very requirement to go beyond probability that meshes the standard of proof in criminal cases with the presumption of innocence and the Crown’s onus. [Emphasis in original.]",
            "48                               Therefore, when this Court held in Starr that the jury charge in that case was inadequate, it was because the errors served to compound the single weakness that the jury was not warned against deciding the case based on “probable guilt”.  In Starr, the trial judge had instructed the jury that the concept of reasonable doubt (1) has no “special connotation”; and (2) should not be equated with absolute certainty; but (3) the jury was not cautioned against deciding on the basis of probable guilt.  Thus the jury was essentially directed to use an ordinary standard – probability – and then was not explicitly advised that probable guilt was an inappropriately low standard on which to base criminal guilt.  As Iacobucci J. put it, at para. 239:",
            "52                               Nevertheless, it should be stressed that no special incantation of the words “balance of probabilities” or “probable guilt” is required.  It is sufficient, yet necessary, to ensure that on the whole the jury is aware that such a standard cannot be used to determine criminal guilt.  In Russell, the exclusion of a reference to the probability standard was not fatal.  This was because on reading the jury charge as a whole, there was still no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have misapprehended that its duty was to apply a higher standard of proof."
        ],
        "Facts": " 3The appellant was convicted in February of 1997 by a jury, on charges of the attempted murder of his wife and of assault causing bodily harm to his daughter.  The incident giving rise to those charges occurred in August of 1996, where the appellant was alleged to have attempted to strangle his wife and assault his daughter in the midst of a struggle at the wife’s place of residence.  4The Crown claimed that the accused attacked his wife with the intent to strangle her using a length of rope.  This attempt was thwarted when the daughter unexpectedly intervened and a loud struggle, during which the daughter was assaulted by the appellant, forced the appellant to flee the scene.  The appellant claims to have been struggling with his wife in an effort to prevent her from strangling herself with a length of rope when his daughter entered the room.  The daughter, under the mistaken impression he was assaulting her mother, attacked him and he attempted to subdue her.  Eventually, the struggle became very loud and out of control, and the appellant fled the scene.  The appellant testified as to his version of events, and the appellant’s wife and daughter testified in support of the Crown’s version.  The Crown’s case also rested on some circumstantial evidence.  5The appellant appealed his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on several grounds, including that the trial judge erred in law by misdirecting the jury on the proper definition of reasonable doubt.  The Court of Appeal convened a special five-judge panel, and heard the case with two others,R. v. K. (K.)(2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 35, 2000 BCCA 161, andR. v. Finley(2000), 134 B.C.A.C. 142, 2000 BCCA 160.   The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on the basis that the errors alleged, unlike those made by the trial judge inLifchus,supra, could not have misled the jury.  However, two judges dissented and found that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to give the term “reasonable doubt” its plain and natural meaning, and that this error was compounded by the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury that more than probable guilt was required for a conviction.  The appeal comes before this Court as of right pursuant tos. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.",

        "Facts": " 19It was alleged that the appellant struck the deceased, Jo Anne Feddema, with his truck while she was riding her bicycle.  They lived in a small village in central British Columbia and were acquaintances.  The impact threw her, apparently injured, on the hood of his truck and she shouted, “You’re in trouble now.”  The appellant told the undercover officer that he panicked and killed her by striking her on the head with a blunt instrument.  He provided many details of the killing, including where the killing took place and how he disposed of her body and clothing, and how he had made it look as though she had been the victim of a sexual assault.  20The Crown conceded that without evidence of the appellant’s statements to the undercover officer, “the prosecution’s case collapsed”.  21The alleged confession came about because skillful police work persuaded the appellant over a period of months that undercover officers were all part of a very well‑run criminal enterprise which the appellant might care to join.  Early in the operation, the appellant advised one of the officers that the police did not like him.  When asked why, the appellant said, “They think I did a murder, they think I killed this broad.”  He continued to deny his involvement until towards the end of January 1997.  In the interim, he became ever more entangled in the supposed crime organization.  22The police officer’s evidence was that on January 29, 1997, in a room at the Landis Hotel in Vancouver, he told the appellant that through underworld contacts he could find someone suffering a terminal illness to make a false confession to the murder of Jo Anne Feddema provided the appellant supplied sufficient detail to make the confession believable.  (This was similar to the police work discussed recently inR. v. Mentuck, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, 2001 SCC 76, andR. v. O.N.E., [2001] 3 S.C.R. 478, 2001 SCC 77.)  At that point the appellant freely confessed to the murder, and on the following day took him to the various locations associated with the crime and described the events in detail.  The conversation of January 30th was also recorded but, unlike the tape made in the hotel room, it was of poor quality.  23The police had applied for and obtained an authorization under Part VI of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  By its terms, the authorization permitted the police surreptitiously to record the conversations between the appellant and the officer.  The conversations of January 29 and 30, 1997 were recorded pursuant to the authorization.  Transcripts were prepared.  The undercover officer reviewed the transcripts the day after each conversation took place, and made corrections based on listening to the tape supplemented with his recollection of those conversations.  A.The Evidentiary Rulings  24The trial judge having concluded that the authorization ought to have been refused for insufficiency of evidence, and the tape therefore having been obtained in violation ofs. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the tapes and related transcripts were declared inadmissible.  25The appellant then moved to suppress the evidence of the undercover police officer because he said it was inextricably bound up with the transcripts of the tapes that had been ruled inadmissible.  The trial judge ruled that the officer could give evidence “as to his present recollection of what occurred in that hotel room on January 29th” and, for that purpose, he could make use of the corrected transcripts (euphemistically described as his “notes”) to refresh his memory.  He had not in fact made notes of the conversation, believing that the tape itself, having been authorized, would be admissible.  26This appeal, and the disputed ruling, relate only to the January 29th conversation at the Landis Hotel.  B.The Officer’s Evidence on the Voir Dire  27In the witness box, the officer’s evidence followed closely, often word for word, the corrected transcript of the January 29th conversation.  When challenged by the defence, he explained in avoir direthat, within a day of the original conversation, he had received a typed transcript of the tapes.  He took the tape and the transcribed copy of the tape “and I proofread the transcribed copy with the tape and I made changes on it.  Also adding comments of my own.  I then sent that back to be retyped with my corrections and my comments and I received back the corrected copy”.  The original document showing his handwritten changes and corrections was not entered in evidence.  The retyped “corrected” version is 49 pages in length, double-spaced.  The cross-examination continued:  Q.   -- what you did was you listened to the voices on the tape?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And you identified certain of the voices, for example, as your own, as those of Peter William Fliss and as that of [a third person]?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And there would be some, presumably, areas where you felt you could make out words and you wrote those in?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And that was from the tape?  A.   The tape as well as my memory of the conversation itself.   28Later, when it was suggested to him by defence counsel that the officer’s present recollection of the January 29th conversation was “inextricably bound” up with his subsequent review of the tape and the transcript, he responded:  A.   No, I have a definite independent recollection of the meeting between myself and Mr. Fliss on January 29th,’97.  Q.   Do you have any notes of that independent recollection?  A.   Well, no.  . . .  Q.   . . . the only note you have of the content of the conversation is what you have referred to as your notes which you have been reading from and which are a transcript from the taped cassette of a wiretap of the conversation, correct?  A.   Yes.  29The trial judge found that the officer created a corrected transcript that could properly be described as his “notes”.  He permitted the officer to give in testimony what was “basically a recitation” of the corrected transcript.  C.The Verdict  30The jury, apparently accepting some evidence that death was caused while the appellant was committing or attempting to commit an aggravated sexual assault, returned with a verdict of first degree murder.  31On appeal, because of the conflicting evidence of the Crown’s experts with respect to the alleged sexual assault, a verdict of second degree murder was substituted.  The appeal was otherwise dismissed, Southin J.A. dissenting.  In her view, theviva voceevidence of the officer was inadmissible and the conviction ought to have been quashed.  The appellant now appeals as of right to this Court on the question of law raised by Southin J.A.’s dissent, namely whether the trial judge erred in admitting theviva voceevidence of the police officer of his conversation with the appellant on January 29, 1997, having previously ruled that evidence of the transcript of that same conversation was inadmissible.

C-46, on the following terms:  I HEREBY REFER, pursuant toparagraph 690(c) of theCriminal Code, the application of Patrick Kelly to this Honourable Court with directions to the said Court to hear evidence relating to Dawn Taber and new scientific evidence on the following questions:  1.    In the circumstances of this case, would the new information from Dawn Taber be admissible on appeal to the Court of Appeal?  2.    In the circumstances of this case, would the new information from the scientific experts be admissible on appeal to the Court of Appeal?

The instrument used by the accused to penetrate the victim was a decorated bamboo dildo, which the respondent said he had purchased as a sexual aid in a shop in Mexico.  This dildo is in the shape of a baseball bat, and is approximately 24 inches long.  Although the complainant thought that the large end of the stick had been used to penetrate her, the samples taken for DNA analysis revealed that it is the thin end of the dildo that was inserted into her vagina.  5The complainant testified that the respondent’s assault hurt her, and that she was bleeding afterwards.   She had recently had a uterine infection and thought that this might have contributed to the bleeding.  The respondent denied sexually assaulting the complainant.  He claimed that she was a consenting partner and that she had responded enthusiastically to his advances.  As for the use of the dildo, he testified that the complainant had used it to masturbate herself.  He admitted that this object belonged to him and said that he had used it in the past with several other partners as a sexual stimulant.  6The trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant, gave detailed reasons as to why he did not accept the respondent’s version and concluded that there was no doubt that the accused had committed a sexual assault with a weapon.  He did so without reference to the definition of “weapon” ins. 2of theCriminal Code.  7The Court of Appeal reversed the conviction for sexual assault with a weapon, substituted a conviction for the included offence of sexual assaultsimpliciter, and reduced the sentence accordingly.  The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in concluding that the forced introduction of an object into the vagina of the complainant was sufficient to constitute sexual assault with a weapon, as that term is defined in theCode.

            "14                               However, again in accordance with the reasoning in Mentuck, I find that the ban on publication of information tending to identify the particular officers involved in the operation, including their names, likenesses and physical descriptions, can be regarded as necessary in order to further the proper administration of justice.  Were the current targets of similar undercover operations to become aware that the names of their apparent criminal associates were in fact the names of undercover police officers, the likelihood that the operation would be compromised approaches certainty. I also find that the salutary effects of that limited ban do outweigh the deleterious effects.  The right of the accused to a public trial is not seriously affected, and the purpose of the freedom of expression guarantee is not implicated by this ban.  On the other hand, officers currently in the field may, indeed, find their operations ineffective if their identities and appearances are widely publicized. But I would still restrict the term of this ban to a period of one year from the date on which this judgment is released.  The identity of police officers should not be, as a matter of general practice, shrouded in secrecy forever, absent serious and individualized dangers.  A force of anonymous, undercover police is not the sort of institution the courts may legitimately, in effect, create; such would be the appearance of an order restraining publication of their identities in perpetuity."

        "Facts": " 29The appellant argues that this Court inMoralesandPearsonemphasized the first two grounds for bail denial, suggesting that other grounds must be seen as suspect.  However,Morales,supra, made clear that the grounds for bail denial are not frozen.  Indeed, such a suggestion runs counter to common sense and law.  Parliament may make any law for bail denial it wishes, provided the law meets the constitutional requirements  of theCharter.  30Bail denial to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is not a mere  “catch-all” for cases where the first two grounds have failed.  It represents a separate and distinct basis for bail denial not covered by the other two categories.  The same facts may be relevant to all three heads.  For example, an accused’s implication in a terrorist ring or organized drug trafficking might be relevant to whether he is likely to appear at trial, whether he is likely to commit further offences or interfere with the administration of justice, and whether his detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the justice system.  But that does not negate the distinctiveness of the three grounds.  31I conclude that a provision that allows bail to be denied on the basis that the accused’s detention is required to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is neither superfluous nor unjustified.  It serves a very real need to permit a bail judge to detain an accused pending trial for the purpose of maintaining the public’s confidence if the circumstances of the case so warrant.  Without public confidence, the bail system and the justice system generally stand compromised.  While the circumstances in which recourse to this ground for bail denial may not arise frequently, when they do it is essential that a means of denying bail be available.

        ],
        "Facts": " 4The appellant carried on a business in Edmonton as a paralegal for many years.  He was assisted by Helen Lambert.  He regularly consulted “Pops” Venkatraman, a solicitor, about issues arising in his files, and when advised by “Pops” that matters exceeded his competence he would refer his clients to the Venkatraman law firm.  The Law Society of Alberta took the view that these referrals did not take place frequently enough, and in October 1994 supplied the Prosecutors’ Office in Edmonton with complaints that the appellant was providing legal advice contrary to the AlbertaLegal Profession Act, S.A. 1991, c. L-9.1.  The police investigation eventually led to a 92-count indictment against the appellant for a variety of different transactions related to different complainants.  5The conflict of interest largely concerns the activities of one of the Venkatraman firm’s  associates, Gregory Lazin.  Lazin shared office space and some facilities with the law firm in the fall of 1994. The trial judge found that as of January 1, 1995 he should be considered a member of the Venkatraman  firm for the purpose of conflict of interest and confidentiality by virtue of the extended definition of “firm” adopted by the Law Society of Alberta in itsCode of Professional Conduct(loose-leaf), effective January 1, 1995, at p. ix.  I say “extended meaning” because the evidence established that Lazin was essentially carrying on an independent practice despite the shared facilities.  Effective May 1, 1995, however, Lazin’s practice was rolled into the Venkatraman firm, and Lazin himself became an employee.  He has since left.  6The trial judge concluded that the lack of legal and factual connections among some of the 92 counts required its severance into five separate indictments.  It was agreed that all five indictments would proceed before him and he would, after all the indictments had been dealt with, impose a sentence if convictions were obtained.  7We are concerned here with two of the five indictments. The first trial involved charges that the appellant had fabricated court documents in theDoblankodivorce action.  A second group of charges related to an alleged scheme to defraud  Canada Trust.  The appellant and his business associate, Ms. Helen Lambert, were said  to have combined their efforts to obtain from Canada Trust mortgages on behalf of people whose credit worthiness would have been rejected if their identity had been disclosed.  In one such transaction, for example, a couple called Rambaran wished to buy a property but could not obtain financing by reason of their recent bankruptcy.  The allegation was that the appellant went to Canada Trust ostensibly to obtain a mortgage on behalf of Helen Lambert, but in fact on behalf of the bankrupt Rambaran family, with the intention of having the Rambarans assume the mortgage once the monies had been advanced by Canada Trust.  Other indictments related in part to allegations of the misappropriation of funds from an estate.  8The conflicts of interest involving the Venkatraman firm came from two sources:  (i)  With respect to theCanada Trustindictment, the firm acted simultaneously for the appellant in the criminal proceedings and his business associate Helen Lambert in divorce proceedings at a time when they knew, or ought to have known, that she would also be charged in theCanada Trustcriminal proceedings, with an interest adverse to his.  Two members of the firm visited the appellant at the Remand Centre on April 18, 1995, including Lazin who arrived late and was there for about 12 minutes during a two-hour interview.  At the time he was acting for Helen Lambert.  The trial judge concluded that Lazin attended for no purpose except to collect information from the appellant that would be useful to him in his defence of Helen Lambert in the anticipated criminal proceedings.  Lazin’s plan was to run a “cut-throat defence”, seeking to paint the appellant as the manipulative criminal and Helen Lambert as an innocent dupe.  He was subsequently retained formally as her defence counsel and eventually offered the Crown Attorney’s Office a deal under which Lambert would testify against the appellant if the charges against her were dropped.  As it was put in cross-examination, “in return for Lambert sinking [the appellant], Lambert would walk”.  None of this, obviously, was in the appellant’s interest.  The appellant was belatedly advised that the Venkatraman law firm would not act for him in theCanada Trustcriminal case because of its involvement with Helen Lambert.  (ii)  In July 1995, Lazin, still a member of the Venkatraman firm, was approached by Darren Doblanko whose wife had obtained a divorce with the assistance of the appellant some years previously.  Quite innocently, she had relied on an affidavit of service on Darren Doblanko (who had earlier deserted her).  The affidavit was false.  The jury found that the false affidavit of service had been prepared by the appellant.  Moreover, the wife had innocently relied on a Certificate of No Appeal containing the forged signature of Doblanko.  At the suggestion of the trial judge in theDoblankodivorce, Lazin suggested to Doblanko that he report the forgery to the police.  In fact, Lazin steered Doblanko to the same police officer who was responsible for theCanada Trustfile and other cases pending against the appellant.  It was suggested by the appellant’s counsel that Lazin’s strategy was to multiply the allegations of dishonesty against his client to strengthen the credibility of the “cut-throat” defence he planned to run on behalf of Helen Lambert in theCanada Trustcase.

        "Facts": " 12For several years, the respondent Laurent Laroche and his wife operated Garage Côté Laroche Inc., whose principal business was repairing seriously damaged road vehicles.  A few years later, they added renting out industrial condominiums to that business, and the rentals are now an important source of income for the respondent Laroche.  The building of the condominiums was financed out of substantial investments, the source and legality of which the appellant has questioned.  13In Quebec, for road safety reasons, strict regulations have been put in place and must be complied with when a rebuilt vehicle is put on the road.  Under ss. 546.1et seq.of theHighway Safety Code, R.S.Q., c. C‑24.2, a person who wishes to license a rebuilt vehicle must obtain a certificate of technical compliance from the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ).  The SAAQ or one of its agents will issue a certificate of compliance only when the rebuilt vehicle has been inspected and meets the manufacturer’s standards.  14In the course of an internal audit at Charest Automobile Ltée, which is an agent of the SAAQ, an SAAQ employee found serious irregularities in five rebuilt vehicle files submitted by Garage Côté Laroche Inc.  When the invoices and photos in the files were compared, it appeared that the same parts from a damaged vehicle had apparently been used to rebuild more than one vehicle.  The employee was convinced that the certificates of technical compliance for the vehicles in question had been obtained illegally, and referred the five fraudulent files to the Victoriaville police.  The files involved five Toyota Tacomas which, miraculously, shared some of the same parts.  15After an investigation, the five Toyota Tacomas were seized from their new owners pursuant to a warrant issued under s. 487Cr. C.  Investigations by experts from the Sûreté du Québec and the Groupement des assureurs automobiles showed that no major repairs had been done on the allegedly rebuilt vehicles and that the serial numbers on some of the parts had been altered.  On May 4, 2000, based on those analyses, the Crown filed charges of forgery, uttering forged documents and possession of stolen property against Laurent Laroche.  16Over the next few months, the police investigation took on dimensions that had been unsuspected at the outset.  It covered dozens of rebuilt vehicle files submitted between 1998 and 2000.  During the period of the investigation, the police obtained a number of search warrants under ss. 487 and 487.01Cr. C., and in addition, on February 18, 2000, they seized 154 rebuilt vehicle files involving Garage Côté Laroche Inc. and other companies related to Laurent Laroche from the SAAQ agent, which had issued the certificates of compliance for the five Toyota Tacomas.  An analysis of 142 of those 154 files showed serious irregularities in 98 cases.  They included the fact that identical invoices and photographs were found in more than one file, as well as invalid serial numbers.  A number of invoices were from businesses either non‑existent or no longer in operation on the billing date.  As well, parts that had apparently been purchased in the United States had been invoiced in French, with the G.S.T. and Q.S.T shown on the invoice!  17The scope of the respondents’ illegal activities prompted the police to extend their investigation to Laurent Laroche’s recent real estate acquisitions.  The title searches done regarding Laroche’s properties showed that he had apparently purchased immovables valued at about $1,800,000, and that there were no hypothecary charges against them.  On those findings being made, a police officer who was an investigator with the city of Victoriaville, Luc Morin, signed an affidavit in support of an application for a restraint order and special warrants of seizure, and the affidavit was submitted to Judge Pinard of the Court of Québec.  That application is what led to these proceedings.

        "Facts": " 7In stating the verdict, the foreperson coughed or stuttered, causing listeners to hear different verdicts.  The verdict as pronounced was never repeated or confirmed by the court.  Although the trial judge thought he heard “not guilty as charged”, later that same afternoon, he admitted to having “a raging head cold” and acknowledged that there was something “unusual” about the verdict.  The court reporter initially recorded the foreperson’s verdict as “(inaudible) guilty as charged” and, when examined the next day, testified that he “couldn’t be sure” what the foreperson said at the moment of hearing it.  Even after replaying the original tape in the courtroom “eight to twelve” times, he was unable to discern what the verdict was (albeit at “normal speed” he heard “guilty as charged”).  The court officer testified that she had been unable to understand the foreperson due to a “rumbling” or “gurgling” noise he made while delivering the verdict.  Ten of the eleven jurors testified under oath that they heard the foreperson say “guilty”, the eleventh stated that she was not able to hear the verdict as announced.  The foreperson testified that he sometimes stammered and also had a soft tone of voice, but that he had said “guilty as charged”.  8Also significant in this case is the manner in which the error was brought to the attention of the court.  After the verdict was announced on September 18, the jury was escorted by the court officer from the courtroom to the jury room.  Within about 30 seconds after leaving the courtroom, the court officer asked the foreperson what the verdict was.  At this point, all 12 jurors were back in the jury room and still within the care and control of the court.  In the presence of all of the other members of the jury, the foreperson replied, “You’re kidding, guilty”.  Although some of the jurors were in a position to overhear what was said, none of them contradicted the foreperson’s statement.  The jurors were then escorted down a private elevator in order to exit the building, which is typical when there is a guilty verdict.  On the way back to her office, the court officer heard that the court deputy had said that the verdict was “not guilty”.  She testified that she knew immediately that an error had been made.  9Within approximately seven to nine minutes after the announcement of the verdict in court, the court officer informed the trial judge of the error.  Two constables at the court found the foreperson and another juror in the parking lot.  Both jurors were alone and separately confirmed to one of the constables that the verdict was guilty.  Within about 25 minutes of the discharge of the appellant, the trial judge had the foreperson and the other juror back in court.  Under oath, the foreperson confirmed to the trial judge that the jury’s verdict was guilty and that he had pronounced a guilty verdict in the courtroom.  In my view, there is no question of the foreperson’s verdict being altered as a result of anything he heard after returning the initial verdict; any possibility that he was tainted after exiting the building into the parking lot is completely mitigated by the fact that he had already disclosed the error to the court officer while still within the care and control of the court.  10Around the time the trial judge was questioning the foreperson, the court officer called the remaining 10 jurors at their homes and asked them to return to the courthouse.  She also asked one of the jurors on the phone “off the record” what the verdict was; like the foreperson and the other juror found in the parking lot, the juror said “guilty”.

        "Facts": " 6At approximately 4:00 a.m. on July 21, 1998, Shaun Baksh was discovered lying on the east side of Barrington Avenue in Toronto.  He had been stabbed in the chest and died a short time later at St. Michael’s Hospital.  The subsequent autopsy confirmed that he had received a single knife wound to the heart.  7On August 12, 1998, Donna Robertson told two homicide detectives that her then boyfriend, the appellant, David Benson, had told her that he was the person who had killed Baksh.  According to Robertson’s account, Benson told her that he had  gone out to the fire escape one night when he could not sleep.  A man with an accent approached him and offered to sell him drugs.  Benson declined, but he persisted and put his arm around Benson.  Benson told the man to “back off” and, when he refused, Benson pulled a knife and stabbed him.  The man then staggered away through the adjacent park and then west toward Barrington Avenue.  Benson threw away the clothes that he was wearing, except for his shoes.  8Robertson also told the police that Benson told her that he had confessed to his lawyers, Edward Greenspan, and later Todd Ducharme and Peter Copeland.  She said that she had gone with Benson to meet Mr. Copeland, and that he had provided them with business cards on which he wrote words that purported to invoke the right to silence in the face of police questioning.  Robertson produced her card to the police.  9The police investigated Benson in relation to the homicide for a number of months.  The investigation included a consent wiretap of Robertson’s home telephone and the interception of her communications with Benson using a body pack.  Armed with a search warrant, the police seized clothing, knives and footwear from Benson’s residence.  All items tested negative for the blood of the deceased.  Benson has since denied killing Baksh.  Benson was never charged with respect to the murder and the investigation against him was dropped.  10The respondent Jason Brown was seen looking for Baksh on the morning that Baksh was killed.  Brown was also looking for a mountain bike that he had allegedly fronted to Baksh as part of a drug deal.  Witnesses stated that Brown had in his possession a napkin, on which Baksh’s pager number was written in red ink.  A videotape showed Brown entering his own apartment building, located one block from the crime scene, at 4:47 a.m. on July 21, 1998, less than an hour after Baksh had been found stabbed.  11On July 29, 1998, under warrant, the police seized from Brown’s apartment, among other things, a napkin with the deceased’s pager number on it.  Brown entered his apartment during the search and provided a statement to the police in which he denied knowing the deceased, denied knowing anything about a mountain bike, and said that he had been home on the night of the homicide.  12On July 31, 1998, with counsel present, Brown gave a second statement to the police.  In this statement, he said that he had bought cocaine from the deceased three times on the night and early morning of the homicide.  On the third such time, Brown said that he had no money and therefore fronted a stolen mountain bike for more cocaine.  Brown wanted the bike back and said that he would bring money later for the cocaine.  He denied killing Baksh.  13Brown was charged with Baksh’s murder on November 1, 1999.  Prior to that date, the police claimed to lack reasonable and probable grounds to charge either Benson or Brown with the homicide.  Brown’s charge came shortly after a jailhouse informant, who had shared a cell with Brown at the Toronto jail in November 1998, reported that he had overheard a conversation between Brown and a third inmate, McDoom.  According to the informant, Brown told McDoom that he had purchased drugs from Baksh, stabbed him, and taken a bag of crack cocaine.  14Although the informant was called as a witness at the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor has not yet received the approval of the “In-Custody Informer Committee” within the office of the Attorney General to call the informant at trial.  The Committee is waiting for the final determination of Brown’sMcClureapplication and a further determination of whether the Crown may review the material ordered disclosed to Brown in order to assess the reliability of the informant.

            "1                                   Binnie J. — The 1991 amendments to the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (“Cr. C.”) established a new review system for individuals, like the respondent, who have been found not criminally responsible for a criminal offence on account of mental disorder.  In the respondent’s case, the offence was second degree murder committed in 1978 in a psychotic state induced by drug abuse.  On May 17, 2000, the Ontario Review Board (“Board”), after a full hearing, concluded that the respondent continued to constitute a significant danger to the safety of the public and ordered his continued detention at the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital (“KPH”).  At the Court of Appeal, the Crown sought to bolster the Board’s decision with fresh affidavit evidence which alleged that, since the date of the Board hearing, the respondent had punched another patient, threatened to kill yet another patient, and was found in possession of prohibited drugs.  The Court of Appeal declined to admit the fresh evidence, proceeded to review the Board’s order based on the evidence available at the original hearing, allowed the appeal, set aside the Board’s order as unreasonable, and directed that the respondent be absolutely discharged.",
            "2                                   In my view, the appeal should be allowed.  Giving due deference to the Board’s expertise in these matters, its decision was not unreasonable on the record before it.  Moreover, with respect, the Court of Appeal erred in law in rejecting, without reasons, the fresh evidence.  Evidence of violent behaviour in the year 2000 by the respondent was relevant to the crux of the court’s decision that the respondent should no longer be detained as a significant threat to the safety of the public.  The fresh evidence confirmed in part the factual basis of the Board’s May 17, 2000 order.  The statutory procedure for dealing with individuals adjudged not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder is inquisitorial, not adversarial.  A decision to grant an absolute discharge should be based on the best information available including, where appropriate, fresh information before a court of appeal that postdates the original Board hearing.",
            "3                                   The disposition of this appeal will have limited effect on the respondent.  We are dealing with events that are now three years in the past.  He is entitled to an expert and independent review of his detention at least every 12 months, and sooner “at any time”, in the Board’s discretion (s. 672.82(1)).  These annual reviews, required by the Criminal Code , will continue until he receives an absolute discharge.  He is thereby assured that any further disposition orders regarding his continued detention or eventual discharge will be made on up-to-date information and assessments.  Fairness is thereby assured to both the respondent and to the public.",
            "5                                   Prior to the 1978 murder, the respondent had acquired a criminal record for breaking and entering, obstructing a police officer, trafficking in narcotics, possession of narcotics and possession of stolen property.",
            "19                               The court reviewed the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  including “the need to protect the public from dangerous persons” (s. 672.54) and expressly noted that the onus was on the Crown to establish that the respondent constitutes “a significant threat to the safety of the public” (s. 672.54(a)).  Reference was made to Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625.  The court noted that the KPH had not considered the respondent to be a significant risk to public safety between 1994, when it had recommended an absolute discharge, and 1999.  In the court’s view, the Board had wrongly shifted the focus from the protection of the public to the prevention of the respondent’s abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs.  It concluded that the evidence before the Board fell short of establishing that the respondent was a significant threat to the safety of the public, even when he was using drugs.  The court therefore ordered an absolute discharge.",
            "20                               The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are attached as Appendix A.",
            "21                               At what point should an individual who has been found not criminally responsible for murder on account of mental disorder related to substance abuse, and who refuses to control his habit, be given an absolute discharge to return without restriction to the community?  The individual in this case says he was entitled to an absolute discharge at least by May 1998 and, as stated, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with him.",
            "22                               An individual who is found to have committed a criminal act or omission under the influence of a mental disorder is not acquitted.  Rather, if it is concluded that the mental disorder impaired his or her capacity at the time of the offence to appreciate the nature and quality of what was done or omitted, or of knowing that it was wrong, he or she must be adjudged by the court to be “not criminally responsible [NCR] on account of mental disorder” (Cr. C., ss. 16(1) and 672.34).",
            "23                               There is no presumption that an NCR individual is a danger to the safety of the public:  Winko, supra, at para. 46.  On the contrary, the Criminal Code  requires that persons found NCR be granted an absolute discharge unless the court or a Review Board is able to conclude that the individual poses a significant risk to the safety of the public.  Even when this risk is established, the disposition is to be “the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused” consistent with the level of risk posed, i.e., ranging from detention “in custody in a hospital” to discharge “subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate” (Cr. C., s. 672.54).",
            "31                               The appellant submitted an extensive analysis of the Court’s administrative law jurisprudence applying the “functional and pragmatic test” to establish the appropriate standard of review from U.E.S., Local 298 v. Bibeault, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1048, at p. 1087, to Moreau-Bérubé v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249, 2002 SCC 11.  However, in the case of these review boards, Parliament has spelled out in the Criminal Code  the precise standard of judicial review, namely that the court may set aside an order of the review board only where it is of the opinion that:",
            "34                               The Crown asks us to apply the test of “unreasonable verdict” in criminal cases, citing R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, and R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, 2000 SCC 15.  There are parallels between the language of s. 672.78 Cr. C. dealing with appellate review of an NCR disposition order, and s. 686 Cr. C. dealing with appellate review of verdicts in criminal cases, and there is authority for that proposition:  see Peckham v. Ontario (Attorney-General) (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 454.  However, with respect, we should be mindful of the differences in context, regardless of the similarity in the wording of the statutory provisions.  An NCR disposition order is not punitive:  Winko, supra, at paras. 41 and 71.  It arises out of a process that is inquisitional, not adversarial, that takes place before an administrative board, not a court.  To the extent the Crown seeks to raise the bar of judicial review higher than reasonableness simpliciter, I think the attempt should be resisted.  An NCR disposition order is to be reviewed on the basis of administrative law principles.  Resort must therefore be taken to the jurisprudence governing judicial review on a standard of reasonableness simpliciter, as most recently discussed in Dr. Q, supra, at para. 39, and Ryan, supra, at para. 47.",
            "40                               However, the Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence “fell short of establishing that the appellant is a significant threat to the safety of the public, even when using drugs” (para. 29).  I entirely accept that the court should be vigilant in protecting the liberty of persons detained under the NCR provisions of the Criminal Code , but this vigilance must be tempered with recognition of the inherent difficulty of the subject matter and the expertise of the medical reviewers.  As stated in Winko, supra, at para. 61:"

        "Facts": " 4On October 10, 1978, the respondent was found not guilty by reason of a mental disorder of a charge of second degree murder.  The circumstances of the murder (the “index offence”) were described in the report of the North Bay Psychiatric Hospital dated October 1990, as follows:  [The respondent] had been living with the 22 year old [male] victim, who was from the Chatham area.  They had been together about three months.  The offence occurred in the morning, but the [respondent] stated he did not remember too much.  He remembered having been paranoid for some weeks prior to the offence and that he had this song in his head.  He cannot remember what the song said.  He had slept at night before the offence and remembered having an apple spiked with MDA.  In the morning the [respondent] and another man shared this apple.  The [respondent] states that he had been scared and paranoid for some time but he was not quite conscious of it.  However, after consuming the apple he was afraid of his friend and believed that his friend had been involved in the killing of his grandfather, although [the respondent’s] grandfather was not killed but died of natural causes.  The [respondent] remembered hitting the man with a stick or something.  [The respondent] also had a gun.  After the offense he stopped and stood there until the police came.  The man died shortly afterwards of the wounds that were inflicted.  [The respondent] was charged with Murder.  5Prior to the 1978 murder, the respondent had acquired a criminal record for breaking and entering, obstructing a police officer, trafficking in narcotics, possession of narcotics and possession of stolen property.  6Following a period of detention in various institutions for mental health care, the respondent was gradually released into the community until 1987 when he was arrested on charges of possession of a prohibited weapon, break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of property obtained by crime.  On June 15, 1988, he was convicted of all three charges.  Following completion of his sentence, the respondent was returned to the North Bay Psychiatric Hospital.  In 1989, he got into a disagreement with the staff about hospital privileges, and the hospital report indicates that he lost his self-control and punched a car door so hard that he broke bones in his hand, requiring a cast.  The respondent was reported to have stated, “[i]t was either the door or Brad’s jaw, man, I had to hit something”.  Subsequently, in January 1990, while living in the community, the respondent severely fractured a man’s jaw with a pool cue during a disagreement while under the influence of alcohol.  The respondent was convicted of assault causing bodily harm on June 7, 1990, and sentenced to 14 months in prison.  7Thereafter, efforts were again made to release the respondent gradually into the community, but the problems with substance abuse re-occurred, and he continued to show some propensity towards violence.  In 1991, for example, the respondent was admitted to the KPH’s secure unit.  While there, he engaged in what were called “assaultive behaviours” while under the influence of alcohol.  A 1992 risk assessment conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Health placed the respondent in a category of violent offenders for which it was predicted that 44 per cent would re-offend violently within seven years after release.  A 1992 KPH report signed by the hospital medical staff noted that the respondent’s risk assessment included abuse of street drugs and/or alcohol, and violence against other persons:  [The respondent’s] prognosis continued to be extremely guarded given his lack of insight into his situation, his lack of regard for other persons, and his intolerance of the system.  It was predicted that a circumstantial situation will likely compromise his liberty at an early stage in community living.  [The respondent] has a history of repeated offences, including unprovoked violence, indulgence in drugs and alcohol, and a cavalier attitude, making him a serious risk to the community.  8Nevertheless, Board dispositions in 1994, 1995 and 1996 provided for conditional discharges.  In 1997, the respondent’s urine tested positive for cannabis, and KPH told the Board that it could no longer support a Conditional Discharge Order because of the respondent’s continued substance abuse and the hospital’s need for flexibility “to react quickly to known increases in risk”: ",

        "Facts": " 22The appellant, S.A.B., was accused of the sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old girl pursuant toss. 271and153(1)(a) of theCriminal Code.  The indictment stemmed from incidents that took place in Hinton, Alberta, around July of 1996.  A few months following the alleged sexual assault, the young complainant discovered that she was pregnant at which point she advised her mother that the appellant, S.A.B., who had been living with the complainant’s family for several months, had sexually assaulted her.  The complainant had an abortion and the police seized the fetal tissue for DNA testing.  23Pursuant to anex partewarrant authorizing the seizure of a blood sample under ss. 487.04 to 487.09, the police seized a blood sample from the appellant and conducted DNA analysis.  Typically, forensic DNA analysis will compare two samples of DNA to determine if they match.  In this case, the forensic DNA analysis compared the appellant’s blood sample with the fetal tissue (the combined DNA of the complainant and the accused) taken from within the complainant’s body in order to confirm or deny that the appellant had fathered the fetus.  Essentially, a paternity test was conducted with the appellant’s DNA.  Such use of the DNA is contemplated by the legislation per s. 487.05(1)(b)(ii).  The appellant was arrested and charged with sexual assault.  At trial, the appellant sought a declaration that the DNA warrant provisions in ss. 487.04 to 487.09 violatess. 7and8of theCharter.  24During the trial, evidence was presented that five of the seven DNA  samples taken from the appellant were conclusive and established the probability that S.A.B. was not the father of the fetus to be 1 in 10 million.  The sixth test sample was damaged and yielded inconclusive results. The seventh sample did not match the appellant’s DNA.  This non‑matching sample was determined by the Crown DNA expert to be a mutation and was therefore disregarded.  The DNA expert, Dr. Szakacs, testified that “mutations are well documented in paternity testing, and the international guidelines state that at least two exclusions have to be noted before parental exclusion can be determined”.  No evidence was given as to the nature of the international guidelines referred to.  If the non-matching sample was not a mutation, there would be no possibility that the accused was the father of the fetus.  The appellant argued that the opinion evidence of the DNA expert lacked a factual foundation.

        "Facts": " 2On the night of December 17, 1995, two cars drove by very close to a group of eight people who were walking on a sidewalk.  A passenger in one of the cars opened fire and two pedestrians were killed.  3There was very little information available to the police when the investigation first started.  On January 26, 1996, Herby Jean‑Charles, who was then incarcerated on a robbery charge, asked to meet with the detective in charge of the investigation into the shooting.  He then offered to provide them with information, in exchange for a deal.  He told the police officers that the appellant was one of those involved in the double murder.  However, the negotiations broke off because Mr. Jean‑Charles' demands were considered to be unrealistic.  4The investigators met with the appellant on several occasions while he was incarcerated at Leclerc Institute to obtain his cooperation.  They were met with refusal.  During that time, the security classification assigned to the appellant, who was also a suspect in another murder case, was revised upward and he was placed in administrative segregation.  On November 6, 1996, the investigators again interviewed Mr. Jean‑Charles, at the Donnacona penitentiary, and entered into an agreement with him under which he was to become a “special witness” and participate in recording a conversation with the appellant.  A consent to the interception of private communications was signed on that date (ss. 184.1and184.2of theCriminal Code).  The appellant was transferred to Donnacona and on November 18, 1996, he had a conversation with Mr. Jean‑Charles which was recorded.  5On September 3, 1997, two first degree murder charges and six attempted murder charges were laid against the appellant.  Following avoir direheld between February 26 and March 3, 1998, the judge found the evidence from the interception of the private communication to be admissible:  [1998] Q.J. No. 1276 (QL).  That communication was the Crown's principal evidence against the appellant.  6The appellant's defence rested primarily on his assertion that he had fabricated the information he related to the informer, Herby Jean‑Charles, on November 18, 1996, which information was tape recorded.  He said that he had invented that story after learning from the police and Herby Jean‑Charles that an Emmanuel Zéphyr [translation] “was out to get [him]”.  His justification for concocting an incriminating lie was that he hoped to earn the respect of his fellow inmates by saying he had committed the murder, and that this “notoriety” might have enabled him to escape any reprisals from Emmanuel Zéphyr.  He said that he had put together the details of his lie from details related in the newspapers, from his imagination and from information provided to him by third parties.  7On March 11, 1998, at the very end of the trial, the appellant repeatedly refused to answer questions concerning the identity of the third parties who had allegedly provided him with information about the crime.  The reason given by the appellant was that answering those questions could put his life and the lives of his family members in danger.  8The proceeding out of which the appeal arises took place as follows.  At the end of the examination‑in‑chief of the appellant, counsel for the appellant asked him the following two questions:  [translation]  Q  Mr. Arradi, can you now give us the names of the persons, the two persons from whom you received these confidences?  A  No, I can't.  Q  Why? A  Because it would put my life and the lives of my family in danger, and it is against my principles.  I will never do that.  Q  The “beef” you are taking, who are you taking it for?  A  I can't tell you that either.  Q  I have no other questions for the witness.  9At the outset of her cross‑examination, counsel for the Crown returned to the question, as follows:  [translation]  Q  You agree with me.  You say that you received confidences concerning this shooting?  A  Yes, that's correct.  Q  It's correct that you received confidences.  Can you tell us, first, in what circumstances you received those confidences?  A  No particularly special circumstances, just in talking.  Q  Fine.  Okay.  We are going to get you to give us a few more details. “No particularly special circumstances”, fine.  Let's start with the place, for example, where those confidences took place.  A  In an apartment.  Q  In an apartment.  An apartment.  What apartment?  A  I refuse to answer that question.  That could identify and point the finger at people.  Q  So you do not want to answer the question about the apartment?  You don't want, if I understand you, to give the members of the jury the address of that apartment?  The judge then intervened:  [translation]  Q  I am certain that your counsel has informed you of the consequences that may arise from refusing in court to answer the questions put to you.  A  Yes, your Honour.  Q  I am certain that your counsel has explained to you that refusing to answer a question would be, on its face, a contempt of court.  A  Yes, I have been informed of that, your Honour.  Q  And that refusing to answer questions in a murder case is an especially serious contempt of court.  A  I have been informed of this, your Honour.  Yes, it is serious. ",

        "Facts": " 4The appellant has displayed symptoms of chronic schizophrenia since at least 1986 and has been hospitalized on numerous occasions as a result of his illness.  His mental disorder has been linked to a lengthy criminal record which includes convictions for theft, mischief, failing to appear and breach of probation.  In 1987, he was convicted of sexual assault.  5On March 11, 1991, at a rooming house for persons with mental disorders, he stabbed a male staff-worker under the delusional belief that this worker had both beaten and raped him and was about to strangle his mother.  He feared he was about to be strangled.  The appellant was charged with assault with a weapon.  He was found not criminally responsible (“NCR”) on account of mental disorder.  6On August 13, 1991, he was committed to the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital, amediumsecurity facility.  On January 19, 1993, the Ontario Review Board ordered his transfer to amaximumsecurity facility (the Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre).  The appellant submits that his earlier transfer occurred so that he could take part in recreational activities at Oak Ridge and improve the quality of his life.  The Crown submits he was transferred because he posed “a serious management problem” at the medium security hospital where he refused treatment and behaved inappropriately.  For the purpose of this appeal, we need not decide why he was transferred in 1993.  7At Oak Ridge, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from substance abuse and chronic paranoid schizophrenia, a personality disorder with anti-social traits.  He was last “physically assaultive” in 1996.  In January 1998, he experienced a “significant episode of behavioural dysfunction”.  The appellant also engaged in “sexually inappropriate behaviour”.  The most recent such episode was in 1998.  8According to nursing notes dated May 24, 2000, the appellant said that voices from a television set had told him to stop taking his medication, and that his brother had been calling and wanted him out of Oak Ridge.  The appellant requires drugs to control his mental disorder.  He objects to taking the medication, however, and it is administered by substitute consent provided by his father.  In the 12 months prior to the most recent Board Disposition, the appellant had developed a problem with “water intoxication”.  The hospital Administrator recommended his continued detention at Oak Ridge maximum security institution.

        "Facts": " 5The victim, a young Newfoundlander named Jerome Fleming, was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest at short range.  His body was found in the woods near Bay Bulls.  Smith was seen with the victim a few hours before the likely time of death.  They had been drinking together.  The victim was not again seen alive.  There was circumstantial evidence that linked Smith to the shotgun that was used in the killing.  There was some suggestion in the evidence that a drug deal had gone bad.  The prosecution’s case depended largely on inculpatory statements made to the investigating RCMP officer over a five-day period, and a “confession” to a jail house informant.  6There is no doubt that Smith’s alleged statements to the RCMP officer, if accepted at face value, were inculpatory.  At one point, he is alleged to have said to the police interrogator, “[T]here is no explanation for dumping your best buddy in the woods” (appellant’s record, at p. 113).  Later, Smith was asked by the police officer if the shotgun used in the killing was still available, to which he replied, “[N]o, the gun is not available.”  He then added that what hemeantto say was thatifhe had done it, then the gunwouldnot be available.  7When a police officer suggested that perhaps Fleming’s death was accidental, Smith said that he would see if his lawyer could work out a “deal”.  If so, he would talk to the police and, if not, he would take his chances on a murder charge.  8As mentioned, Smith was convicted and properly filed a notice of appeal.  However, and despite his efforts, the appeal remained pending until his death.  The Crown moved to have it abated some seven years later.  Counsel retained by Smith shortly before his death was then appointed by the court to represent the interests of the “Smith family”.  There was no formal substitution of a live appellant for the deceased.  (This is an irregularity to be addressed below.)  Counsel’s argument is that the members of Smith’s family still bear the emotional, social and psychological scars of the murder conviction.  They have made every effort to carry on the struggle to clear the family name since his death.  The justice of their struggle and the failure of the legal system to respond adequately to Smith’s original appeal during Smith’s lifetime, he says, merit thepost-mortemintervention of the court.

        "Facts": " 3In December 1997, the Quebec City police conducted an investigation of second-hand store owners suspected of selling stolen merchandise.  As part of the investigation, investigators Tremblay and Gagné were ordered to set up an operation using an undercover officer codenamed “Agent 008” who would offer merchandise he claimed to be stolen to selected merchants.  4The respondent Claude Daoust owns three pawn shop/second-hand stores, including Argent Comptant, a business located in Quebec City.  The respondent Éric Bois is the manager of this establishment.  Between December 2 and 5, 1997, the undercover officer went to Argent Comptant on four different occasions to offer merchandise to the respondents Daoust and Bois.  The undercover officer would hint he had criminally obtained goods to sell.  Disguised so as to give the impression he was a financially disadvantaged person, he approached the respondents on four occasions, offering to sell them two new video cassette recorders, a slightly used video cassette recorder, two new telephones and a new alarm clock.  He received a total of $60 for the goods.  5As none of the merchandise offered and sold by the undercover officer was actually stolen, but had instead come from a merchant who had agreed to lend the goods to the police for the purposes of their investigation, the objective of the operation was to establish if the respondents were laundering merchandise as part of their normal commercial activities while believing, if not knowing for certain, that the goods were stolen.  The undercover officer was supposed to offer the merchandise while mentioning that it was “hot” or indicating as much in similar terms such that there could be no doubt that the goods were illegally obtained.  6According to the officer’s notes, the first “sale”, that of a used Sony video cassette recorder with remote control, unfolded as follows:  [translation]  – Daoust:  “Does it work?” (referring to the video equipment).  – 008:  “I don’t know.  It’s not mine.  It’s hot.  I have to unload it.”  – Daoust: (staring closely at the undercover officer and smiling faintly) “You got any I.D.?”  – 008:  “Yeah, but don’t call the police.  I don’t want any trouble, O.K.?”  – Daoust:  “Well, I can’t give you $50 for stuff like that.  I’ll give you $20 if it works.”  – 008:  “Come on.  Give me at least $30.  I need the money.”  – Daoust:  “If it’s stolen, $20 and not a penny more.”  7Similar meetings leading to sales occurred over the next three days.  The last transaction, one involving a new Sony video cassette recorder, ended with the merchandise being accepted for $5.  At that time, the respondent Daoust told the undercover officer that this was the last time they would do business together, to which the respondent Bois added, [translation] “We can’t always be helping you to steal.”  8In accordance with Quebec City municipal by-law 755, which requires that all transactions be recorded in a register, the transactions between the undercover officer and the respondents were entered in the shop’s computer.  However, the copy of the contract normally given to the client was deliberately torn up, while the respondents kept the originals in their files.  9Shortly after the final transaction, that is, during the afternoon of December 5, 1997, police officers went to the shop and executed a search warrant to recover the goods from the previous transactions.  In two separate cases, the respondents were charged under ss. 141 and 462.31(1)(a)Cr. C.with compounding an indictable offence and laundering proceeds of crime.  The evidence presented at the respondent Daoust’s trial, including his testimony, was introduced with consent at the trial of the respondent Bois, who chose not to testify.

        "Facts": " 21At the time of the offence, the respondent, Fontaine, worked “under the table” as a garage mechanic. On February 10, 1999, he received a call from Jules Renaud, a disgruntled former employee, who said, [translation] “We’re coming to get you, pigs.”  22Two days later, Robert Dompierre, the victim, appeared at the garage and told Benoît Randall, who worked there with Fontaine, that someone had tried to hire him to murder both Randall and Fontaine.  He told Randall as well that there was [translation] “a contract out on their heads”.  Randall later that day shared this information with Fontaine.  23On February 14, 1999, Fontaine and his girlfriend, Diane Boulé, went to a meeting.  Fontaine and Boulé testified that four men were watching him there and  two of them followed him into the washroom, where he had gone to smoke marijuana.  24Upon leaving the meeting, Fontaine used his remote starter lest an explosive device had been installed in his car.  Fontaine then advised Randall that he had been followed.  Together, they purchased a firearm.  25That same evening, Fontaine saw Renaud lurking outside his home.  He called Randall, who came by but noticed nothing unusual.  During the night, Fontaine again smoked marijuana.  At around four o’clock in the morning, he thought he heard someone breaking into his home.  He fired his gun at the doors and windows and into the walls.  Fontaine later told his girlfriend and Randall that he thought he had shot some nocturnal intruders.  26Later that morning, Dompierre came to the garage to pay a debt he owed  the proprietor. Seeing Dompierre approach, Fontaine grabbed his gun and shot Dompierre twice.  Dompierre attempted to flee.  Fontaine followed him outside, fired five more shots in his direction and wounded him fatally.  27Fontaine fled the scene but later turned himself in to the police.  28During his interrogation, Fontaine claimed that he had shot Dompierre to prevent Dompierre from carrying out the “contract on his [Fontaine’s] head”.  29At trial, Fontaine’s defence was mental disorder automatism.  He testified that he had acted involuntarily and related in detail the circumstances that gave rise to his state of mind at the time of the offence.  He explained that he had “frozen” and had only a partial recollection of the facts concerning the murder of Dompierre.  30Several psychiatric experts also gave evidence. Dr. Richard Laliberté testified that Fontaine had smoked marijuana excessively during the weeks leading up to the murder.  According to Dr. Laliberté, certain aspects of Fontaine’s story were indicative of paranoid delusions, though it was difficult to determine with certainty whether Fontaine’s story was real or delusional.  31Dr. Bruno Laplante, another psychiatrist, testified that Fontaine suffered from a chronic antisocial personality disorder and acute paranoid delusions, but did not fall withins. 16of theCriminal Code.  32Dr. Jacques Talbot, also a psychiatrist, was the main defence expert. He presented two reports. In the first, he concluded that Fontaine had a psychological condition characterized by delusions. These could be triggered by a chemical substance, including marijuana.  Dr. Talbot found that it was difficult to determine to what extent Fontaine’s belief that his life was in danger was fact-driven and to what extent it was delusional.  33In his second report, which he adopted in his testimony, Dr. Talbot stated that Fontaine, at the time of the shooting, was in a psychotic state triggered by substance abuse.  This episode, according to Dr. Talbot, had begun several days earlier and ended several days afterward.  Dr. Talbot concluded that a major psychological problem had so affected Fontaine’s judgment that he was unable to differentiate right from wrong.  34Finally, Dr. Sylvain Faucher, yet another psychiatrist, testified for the Crown, in reply, that Fontaine was not psychotic at the time of the murder and was not psychotic at any time in 1999.

            "2                                   At the hearing of the appeal, the focus of the argument was on whether the requirement in s. 672.54  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , that the disposition order be the “least onerous and least restrictive” of the liberty of the NCR accused, having regard to the factors enumerated in s. 672.54, applied not only to the general disposition of the case (absolute discharge, conditional discharge or detention on conditions), but also to the conditions that form part of that disposition order.  The issue of statutory interpretation was not clearly addressed in its reasons, but the Review Board seems to have proceeded on the basis that the conditions merely had to be shown to be “appropriate”.  In taking that approach, the Review Board followed the earlier jurisprudence of the Ontario Court of Appeal.",
            "4                                   In the result, the Review Board applied the wrong legal test to the appellant’s case.  However, s. 672.78  of the Criminal Code  provides that its order may still stand if it can be shown that no “substantial wrong” was committed.  Here, however, we cannot say that, if the Review Board had acted reasonably on the correct legal test, the result would necessarily have been the same.",

        "Facts": " 12On February 19, 1999, Stephen Barnaby was viciously beaten by five men with baseball bats, four of them said to have been masked.  He was found outside an apartment building, collapsed, shivering, with broken bones and with other severe injuries to his head and legs.  He had no wallet, no house keys and no identification.  13Barnaby told a uniformed officer, with whom he spoke briefly soon after the attack, that he had been beaten over a gold chain.  14Detective Sean Lawson, initially assigned to the case, stated in his “Occurrence Report” that the attack was believed to be over a drug debt and the victim was being less than truthful.  His suspicion in this regard was based on a conversation with Barnaby at the hospital, on the ferocity of the beating, on the fact that Barnaby had a drug-related conviction, and on other elements of Detective Lawson’s own preliminary investigation.  15On the following morning, referring to the Barnaby attack  in his “Daily Major” report summarizing all serious crimes that had occurred during his shift, Detective-Sergeant Ian Ganson wrote: “believed to be [over] a drug debt [. . .] further inquiries”. Ganson, it should be noted, never spoke directly with Barnaby.  He merely relied, in the usual way, on information he had received from subordinate investigators and uniformed officers.  16Lawson’s “Occurrence Report” and Ganson’s “Daily Major” report were disclosed to the defence in a timely manner, as required by law.  SeeR. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.  17Detective Michael Korb and his partner,  Detective Martin Ottaway, took over the investigation the day after the attack and obtained a statement from Barnaby at the hospital.  Korb and Ottaway were aware of the “drug deal gone bad” theory mentioned by Lawson and Ganson, but both testified that it did not influence their investigation.  Unlike Lawson and Ganson, Korb and Ottaway believed Barnaby’s version of the assault and the reasons for it.  18Barnaby, at a photographic line-up, identified the appellant as the unmasked attacker.

The respondent told him that it was the responsibility of the police.  He also asked the respondent whether he was there as a father or police officer, and the respondent replied that he was there as a concerned father and as a police officer.  Mr. Campeau decided that as a police officer, the respondent should have the knife in order to conduct the investigation, and gave it to him.  The respondent, accompanied by Constable Renauld, then drove his wife and son home.  5On May 25, 2000, Mr. Parks, the principal, dissatisfied with how the matter had been handled the previous day, contacted the police and requested that another officer investigate the incident.  Detective Sergeant Lalonde was assigned to the case and when he spoke to the respondent that night, he asked him what sort of knife was involved.  The respondent replied that it was a small jackknife.  Mr. Campeau had looked at the knife in the box after removing the lid but never touched it.  He testified at the preliminary inquiry that the handle and the grip area of the knife were silver in colour with “brass-knuckle type four rings that you would put your fingers through to hold on to the handle”.  Mr. Campeau did not say in direct examination that the handle was made of metal and in cross-examination clarified that by using the descriptor “brass-knuckle type”, he was not suggesting that the handle was made of brass.  6Detective Sergeant Lalonde discovered that the respondent had not made any notes in his police notebook, completed a police report about the incident or secured the knife as an exhibit.  The respondent never complied with a subsequent request to turn the knife over to the police.  7On June 22, 2000, the respondent was charged with twoCriminal Codeoffences:  possession of a prohibited weapon contrary to s. 91(2) and obstruction of justice contrary to s. 139(2).

Ct. J., acting on the s. 490(2) application, held that s. 490 was not engaged at all because the seizure was unlawful. The judge did not rely on the Charter  in reaching this conclusion. He held that “implicitly, if not expressly, the Criminal Code of Canada  confer[red] on [him a]  jurisdiction to make an order for the return of what is found not to be lawfully detained” (para. 45). The difficulty, of course, is that the judge’s exercise of jurisdiction required a basis in the Code. However, s. 490(2) says nothing about the return of things or remedies for unlawful seizure, and only grants power to order an extension of time."

        "Facts": " 5The judicial investigative hearing relates to two alleged acts of terrorism that occurred on June 23, 1985.  An explosion caused the deaths of two baggage handlers and injured four others at the Narita Airport in Japan.  A second explosion caused Air India Flight 182 to crash off the west coast of Ireland, causing the death of all 329 passengers and crew.  6On February 4, 1988, the first accused, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was arrested in England where he was living with his family.  Mr. Reyat was extradited to Canada on December 13, 1989, to face a number of charges relating to the explosion at Narita Airport.  On May 10, 1991, he was convicted on seven counts:R. v. Reyat, [1991] B.C.J. No. 2006 (QL) (S.C.).  7On October 27, 2000, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri were jointly charged with respect to both explosions and the intended explosion of Air India Flight 301.  A few months later, on March 8, 2001, a direct indictment was filed against the accused, Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri, and on June 5, 2001, a new indictment was filed, adding a third accused, Mr. Reyat.  Mr. Reyat plead guilty on February 10, 2003, to a new indictment that charged him with aiding or abetting the construction of the explosive device that was placed on Air India Flight 182.  He was sentenced to five years imprisonment in addition to the time already spent in custody.  8Following Mr. Reyat’s guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter in February 2003, Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri re-elected, before Josephson J. of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, to be tried by a judge alone.  The trial of Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri (the “Air India Trial”) commenced on April 28, 2003 and continues to this date.  9On May 6, 2003, the Crown applied to a judgeex partefor a s. 83.28 order to gather information regarding the Air India offences from the Named Person.  Dohm A.C.J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court issued the s. 83.28 order for a judicial investigative hearing on the strength of an affidavit by a member of the RCMP’s Air India Task Force.  He directed the hearing to be heldin cameraand no notice was given to the accused in the Air India Trial, to the press, or to the public.  He also prohibited the Named Person from disclosing any information or evidence obtained at the hearing.  10Sometime prior to May 20, 2003, when the hearing was to be held, counsel for Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri fortuitously became aware of the order and advised Dohm A.C.J. that they wished to make submissions.  The Named Person retained counsel, and on June 16, 2003, Dohm A.C.J. was advised that the Named Person wished to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 83.28.  Dohm A.C.J. directed that, seven days later, all submissions be heard by Holmes J.  The constitutional challenge to s. 83.28 and the application to have the hearing order of Dohm A.C.J. set aside commenced on June 23, 2003.  Neither the public nor the press was informed.  11On  June 27, 2003, the Air India Trial adjourned for the summer.  That same day, Ms. Bolan from the Vancouver Sun recognized lawyers from the Air India trial and attempted to follow them into a closed courtroom wherein cameraproceedings were taking place.  The trial list disclosed that “R v. I.*(conference)” was taking place before Holmes J. in courtroom 33.  Ms. Bolan contacted counsel for the Vancouver Sun who knocked on the door of courtroom 33.  Counsel was informed by a sheriff that the judge would not entertain a motion at that time for the proceedings to be opened to the public.  12The Vancouver Sun then filed a Notice of Motion and a letter setting out the background with the Supreme Court of British Columbia and asked for an early date for its motion to be heard.  The motion sought an order that counsel for the appellant and a member of the Vancouver Sun’s editorial board, upon filing an undertaking of confidentiality, be provided with access to the pleadings and all materials from the proceedings to date and for an order that the court proceedings be open to the public.  The Vancouver Sun was informed, on July 3, 2003, that Holmes J. would hear its application on July 23, 2003.  13The hearing before Holmes J. continuedin camera, and on July 21, 2003, she issued her reasons dismissing the application to set aside the s. 83.28 judicial investigative hearing.  She did, however, vary the order of Dohm A.C.J. to allow counsel for Malik and Bagri to attend the investigative hearing with the right to cross-examine the Named Person, subject to the restriction that any information received was to be kept confidential by counsel and was not to be shared with the two accused.  The Named Person immediately applied to Holmes J., who, on July 22, 2003, stayed the investigative hearing to September 2, 2003, so that the Named Person could seek leave to appeal to this Court.  None of this was known to the public or press.  14On July 22, 2003, the Vancouver Sun received a call from the registry of the British Columbia Supreme Court indicating that the hearing of its application had been delayed to 10 a.m. the following day, apparently to allow the s. 83.28 proceedings to continuein cameraearlier in the morning.  When the courtroom was finally opened to the public, the Vancouver Sun made its application to be allowed further access to pleadings and proceedings on the filing of an undertaking of confidentiality and for a declaration that s. 83.28 proceedings should not bein camera.  The application was dismissed by Holmes J. on July 24, 2003:  [2003] B.C.J. No. 1992 (QL), 2003 BCSC 1330.  15Immediately prior to Vancouver Sun’s application, Holmes J. delivered, in open court, a synopsis of her reasons for judgment dated July 21, 2003 in which she set out that the hearing before her had involved the constitutional validity of s. 83.28  and the validity of a s. 83.28 order for a judicial investigative hearing. Holmes J. gave a synopsis because the reasons for judgment were sealed.  She also revealed that the questioning of the Named Person had not yet commenced.  It was at this point that the appellant learned that the British Columbia Supreme Court had been involved in the first-ever application by the Crown unders. 83.28of theCriminal Codefor an order requiring a witness to attend a judicial investigative hearing.  The appellant contends that but for serendipity and their persistence, no “synopsis” would have been released and the existence of proceedings under s. 83.28 would not have been made public.  16The synopsis of reasons for judgment dated July 21, 2003, [2003] B.C.J. No. 1749 (QL), 2003 BCSC 1172, set out that “[t]he proceedings concerned the interpretation, application, and constitutionality of the news. 83.28of theCriminal Code, which provides for investigative hearings in relation to terrorism offences, as now defined in s. 2 of theCode” (para. 1).  Holmes J. then explained that an order had been issued under s. 83.28 for a judicial investigative hearing as part of the ongoing Air India Investigation but that the Named Person who was required to attend was neither a suspect nor an accused.  She summarized her findings that the order was validly issued and constitutionally sound; that counsel for Mr. Malik and Mr. Bagri would participate in the investigative hearing because of the unusual circumstance that the Air India Trial was underway; the hearing might have an incidental effect on the Air India Trial but the predominant purpose of the hearing is to further the ongoing investigation; the hearing is subject to restrictions protecting the privacy and other rights and interests of the Named Person and the integrity of the investigation.  17After delivering her synopsis, Holmes J. stated that the s. 83.28 proceeding had been adjourned so that the Named Person could seek leave to appeal to this Court.  On July 25, 2003, LeBel J. ordered that the Supreme Court of Canada file be sealed and that the application for leave be expedited.  Leave was granted on August 11, 2003, to appeal the order of Holmes J. of July 21, 2003.  18On October 6, 2003, the Vancouver Sun was granted leave to appeal the July 24, 2003 order of Holmes J. dismissing its  application for access to the materials in the courts below:  [2003] 2 S.C.R. xi.  The Vancouver Sun, the National Post, and Global Television Network Inc. were also given intervener standing in the constitutional appeal, limited to issues of media access.  Submissions were also made at the October 6 hearing on whether all or part of the constitutional appeal could be opened to the public and the media.  19At the October 6, 2003 leave hearing, the Named Person indicated the constitutional appeal could be conducted in public.  The Attorney General of British Columbia took the position that parts of the appeal, constituting stand-alone issues, could be held in public:  the constitutionality ofs. 83.28of theCriminal Code, the role of the judge, and retrospective application of the provision.  Mr. Bagri submitted that grounds of appeal relating to self-incrimination and privacy unders. 7of theCharter, judicial independence, and retrospectivity could be heard in public.  20This Court heard the constitutional appeal on December 10 and 11, 2003, in its entirety in open court subject to a number of restrictions specified at the start of the oral hearing by the Chief Justice.  During the oral arguments, counsel refrained from mentioning the name and gender of the Named Person, any facts that could identify this person, and any material supporting the order for an investigative hearing.  In addition, the hearing was not broadcast, contrary to the usual practice of the Court.

        "Facts": " 13Chow, Mapara, Wasfi and Shoemaker were jointly charged with the first degree murder of Chand.  Chand, while changing a licence plate on Chow’s car in Mapara’s car lot, was shot seven times by Shoemaker.  14The Crown’s theory of the case was that Chow was privy to Chand’s murder and knowingly remitted to the getaway driver, Binahmad, payment for the contract killing.  15Binahmad, a Crown witness who had been granted immunity from prosecution, testified that Mapara had hired Wasfi to murder Chand and that Wasfi, in turn, recruited Shoemaker to do the killing.  He stated that Chow gave him $7,000 as a “down payment” on the contract, that he remitted the $7,000 to Shoemaker, and that Chow, at Wasfi’s request, gave him an additional $2,000 after the killing to enable him to leave town.  16Chow’s defence was that his payment to Binahmad had nothing to do with the murder and was not intended for Shoemaker.  It related, he said, to a “marijuana project” that he had undertaken with Wasfi.  17Shoemaker did not testify.  18The Crown entered into evidence telephone conversations involving Chow, Wasfi and Mapara.  The calls had been intercepted pursuant to eleven successive authorizations, of which the sixth and seventh yielded evidence crucial to the prosecution’s case against Chow.  Chow sought unsuccessfully to exclude this evidence underss. 8and24(2)of theCharter.  19Oppal J. rejected Chow’s application.  He noted that the use of electronic means to intercept private communications constitutes a search and seizure that will be deemed unreasonable unders. 8of theCharterunless judicially authorized in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.Section 185(1)(e) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, stipulates that the affidavit accompanying an application must disclose the existence of known persons (“knowns”) whose conversations are targeted.  Failure to do so will render unlawful any ensuing interception of a “known’s” communications.  20Oppal J. thought there was “much evidence to indicate that [the police] ought to have known about the existence or identity of Chow” (Ruling onvoir dire, [2001] B.C.J. No. 2959 (QL), 2001 BCSC 1815, at para. 32).  He found it unnecessary, however, to determine whether Chow was a “known” when the first and second authorizations were sought and granted, since the Crown did not rely on any intercepts obtained as a result of any authorizations in which Chow was not named as a target.  Moreover, Oppal J. concluded that the validity of the first and second authorizations had no inherent bearing on the admissibility of the subsequent intercepts: since each authorization represented a separate order, its legality was to be independently determined.  21At the conclusion of the Crown’s case, Chow and Wasfi both applied for severance.  Oppal J. allowed Wasfi’s application, but not Chow’s. ApplyingR. v. Torbiak and Gillis(1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), he held that the “issue to be ultimately determined by the court is whether the refusal to order a separate trial [would result] in a miscarriage of justice”.  Oppal J. found that Chow’s application failed on that test since Shoemaker’s anticipated testimony was of “marginal” import.  22Chow and Mapara both testified.  Shoemaker did not, but in a statement to the police admitted at the trial, he denied having received any payment at all for the killing.  Chow testified that the intercepted telephone calls referred to a marijuana deal and that, in two calls, he realized that Wasfi was referring to a contract killing but said he was not interested.  He said that he thought the money he paid to Binahmad was for the “marijuana project”.  23Chow, Shoemaker and Mapara were all convicted by the jury of first degree murder.  24Chow and Mapara appealed.  Chow’s main grounds were that Oppal J. erred in refusing to grant him a separate trial and in admitting the wiretap evidence.  He submitted as well that the verdict was unreasonable and sought to adduce “fresh evidence” in the form of an affidavit (a “will say” statement) by Shoemaker.  The essence of the affidavit was that Shoemaker, if compelled to testify, would state that he had not received the $7,000 from Binahmad.  25Shoemaker was cross-examined by the Crown on his affidavit. On re-examination by Chow’s counsel, he stated that Binahmad had told him, on the day Binahmad received the $7,000 from Chow, that he (Binahmad) had to attend a meeting about “some old weed business”.  26Speaking for the Court of Appeal, Donald J.A. agreed with the trial judge that « Shoemaker’s evidence was too marginal to justify a severance » (para. 22).  He found that the wiretaps had been properly admitted and that the verdict was reasonable and supported by the evidence.  27After the appeal was heard, but before judgment was entered, Chow sought to re-open the hearing so as to take into account, on the issue of severance, Shoemaker’s reference to the “old weed business”.  Chow’s counsel stated that this aspect of Shoemaker’s examination was not raised at the hearing of the appeal because of his instructions and because of the pressures of time.  Neither explanation is compelling. 28Chow’s application for a re-opening of the appeal was dismissed ((2003), 182 B.C.A.C. 88, 2003 BCCA 248).

        "Facts": " 52Mr. Hamilton, 23 years old at the time,  was alleged to have sold articles on how to commit the aforementioned offences through a website he had created.  Mr. Hamilton had received a “teaser” e-mail advertising the “Top Secret”files, enticing him to purchase the product.  Mr. Hamilton recycled the “teaser” and website format of the company he had purchased the files from, changing only the address, and began e‑mailing his own “teaser” and advertising the files on his website.  The “teaser” was sent to between 300 and 500 people whose addresses he had acquired from published lists.  He made in excess of 20 sales over a number of months.  His activities came to the attention of the Edmonton police through complaints by some recipients of the spam‑mail who either reported it directly to the Edmonton police or to Interpol.  53The “teaser” that Mr. Hamilton received and subsequently used as his own did not make reference to the bomb or break and enter documents, but did refer extensively to the credit card number generator.  The web page did not make reference to any illegal documents.  The relevant parts of the “teaser” are reproduced in my colleague Fish J.’s judgment at para. 8.  As one can see, the “teaser” reads like a typical advertisement for a product, asserting its supposed useful qualities in exaggerated terms.  Mr. Hamilton received the files he purchased on disk and in hard copy.  He testified that the package as a whole interested him, including the “absurd material” and the “money-making opportunities”.   According to him, he thought others might be similarly interested.  54Mr. Hamilton saw a computer generated list containing abbreviated names of the files.  He testified that he skimmed through the file names, proceeding to read further into those that caught his attention.  The computer list contained file names such as:  bombs.txt, bombs2.txt, bombs3.txt, How to Break into a House.txt, and visa hacking.txt.  Of the roughly 200 files consisting of 2000 pages of text, it is these 5 files, about 13 pages in length, that are relevant to the charges.  Except for the “visa hacking” file, Mr. Hamilton testified that he never read or was aware of the files in question.  55The files related to explosive substances are best characterized as “how to” recipes.  They contain ingredient lists and step-by-step instructions for producing several types of homemade bombs.  Evident from its file name, the “How to Break into a House” file is also a “how to” document, listing a series of steps to be followed when attempting to break into a home.  It is short and very basic.  56The “visa hacking” file provides instructions regarding the generation of credit card numbers, which is essentially an exercise in adding and subtracting from an original valid number.  A search of Mr. Hamilton’s computer revealed another document describing a credit card number generator that did not form part of the “Top Secret”files; however, Mr. Hamilton testified that he frequently downloaded information to his computer which he never read, this file being one such example.  Furthermore, a handwritten list of Visa numbers was found.  Mr. Hamilton had used the credit card number generator described in the files, his mother’s credit card being the starting point.  The numbers he generated were all valid save one, but a bank employee testified that no complaints were received regarding their improper use.  Mr. Hamilton testified his motivation in generating numbers was to figure out the mathematics behind credit card number formulation, and not to actually use the numbers.  He testified that he did not know at the time that it would be possible to use a credit card number without a name, expiry date or security number that is found on the back of credit cards.  At the time, Mr. Hamilton had never possessed a credit card of his own.

        ],
        "Facts": " 2The respondent was charged with historical sexual offences, two of which were indecent assault and gross indecency against the complainant when he was between the ages of 14 and 16.  At the time of the alleged offences, the age of consent was 14.  3The respondent, a medical doctor, was an assistant coach of the complainant’s basketball team.  The complainant alleged that his relationship with the respondent began when he was 13 years old.  He claimed that the respondent paid more attention to him than others, picked him up at school sometimes, took him out to lunch, gave him some money and eventually asked him if he wanted to come to his house and rake leaves. When the complainant arrived, the respondent gave him a tour of the house and the first of two incidents of sexual contact allegedly occurred.  4Both alleged incidents, which happened several weeks apart, involved disrobing, kissing on the lips, the respondent rubbing the complainant’s genital area, straddling the complainant’s chest and inserting his penis into the complainant’s mouth.  The second incident also involved the use of ropes to tie the complainant’s wrists to the bed post and ejaculation by the respondent.  5At the preliminary inquiry, after the complainant had described the first incident involving the respondent pushing his penis in and out of his mouth, Crown counsel asked:  Q.  Is this something that you wanted to be doing?  A.  No.  6After the complainant described the second incident, Crown counsel asked:  Q.  Did you want to be engaging in that kind of activity on that day?  A.  No. I think that – I think that I really wanted to spend time with him, but not doing that.  Q.  Why was it that you wanted to spend time with him?  A. Because he had patience for me and he was very kind and understanding and I just felt like I related with him very well under the pretence of what I thought the relationship was.  7The complainant explained that he saw the respondent a few times after the two incidents but avoided any discussion of him returning to the respondent’s house.  The respondent eventually told the complainant that he could not be his friend if he was not going to go to his house and spend time with him.  Their relationship soon ended.  After this part of the complainant’s testimony, Crown counsel asked:  Q.  Why would you avoid that issue?  A.  Because I didn’t want to go.  Q.  And why didn’t you want to go?  A. Because I didn’t want to get involved in the sexual escapades. ",

        ],
        "Facts": " 4Each of the appellants are prisoners serving life sentences for murder and/or manslaughter. Terry Lee May was convicted of first-degree murder for killing one adolescent boy so that he could sexually assault another without interference. David Edward Owen was convicted of second-degree murder for beating his ex-wife to death. Maurice Yvon Roy was convicted of second-degree murder for killing his common law wife. Gareth Wayne Robinson was convicted on two counts of manslaughter after he stabbed his girlfriend and then, three years later, struck his wife on the head with a hammer. Segen Uther Speer-Senner was convicted of second-degree murder in circumstances unspecified in the record before us. After varying periods of incarceration, the appellants became residents of Ferndale Institution, a minimum security federal penitentiary located in British Columbia.  5Between November 2000 and February 2001, all five appellants were involuntarily transferred from Ferndale Institution to medium-security institutions. Mr. May, Mr. Roy, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Speer-Senner were transferred to Mission Institution and Mr. Owen, to Matsqui Institution. It is not in issue that a transfer from a minimum- to a medium-security institution involves a significant deprivation of liberty for inmates. Consequently, the appellants filed grievances and also applied forhabeas corpusrelief withcertiorariin aid directing the responsible correction officials to transfer them back to Ferndale Institution. Their applications were not joined, but the arguments before the British Columbia Court of Appeal were adopted by all five appellants.  6The transfers were the result of a direction from the Correctional Service of Canada (“CSC”) to review the security classifications of all inmates serving life sentences in minimum-security institutions who had not completed their violent offender programming in the aftermath of a sensational crime committed by a former inmate in another province. CSC used computer applications to assist the classification review process. Mr. Roy, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Speer-Senner and Mr. Owen were advised that their transfers were based on a computerized reclassification scale which yielded a medium‑security rating.  Mr. May was told that his security rating had been adjusted because the security classification tool could not rate him as minimum-security because he had not completed violent offender programming. There were no allegations of fault or misconduct.  7The appellants attacked the decision‑making process leading to their transfers. They submitted that a change in general policy, embodied in a direction to review the security classification of offenders serving a life sentence at Ferndale Institution using certain classification tools, was the sole factor prompting their transfers. They said that the transfers were arbitrary, made without any “fresh” misconduct on their parts, and made without considering the merits of each case. The appellants also claimed that their right to procedural fairness was breached by the failure to disclose the scoring matrix for one of the classification tools, leaving them unable to challenge the usefulness of that tool in the decision‑making process.  8The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed thehabeas corpusapplication: [2001] B.C.J. No. 1939 (QL), 2001 BCSC 1335. Bauman J. first considered whether a provincial superior court had jurisdiction to review a federal prisoner’s involuntary transfer on an application forhabeas corpus(withcertiorariin aid) and, in the affirmative, whether it should decline to exercise it. The issue arose because the Federal Court is grantedexclusivejurisdiction in respect ofcertiorariproceedings involving the decisions of federal tribunals by its constituent statute.  9Bauman J. found that he had jurisdiction to hear the application. He relied onR. v. Miller, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, which held that provincial superior courts have retained concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court to issuecertiorariin aid ofhabeas corpusto review the validity of a detention authorized or imposed by a federal board, commission or other tribunal as defined bys. 2of theFederal Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7(formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.)) (“FCA”).  10Bauman J. then dealt with the substantive issues, which he agreed to examine under hishabeas corpusjurisdiction. He found against the appellants. He held that they had not made out their allegations of failure to disclose relevant information, the computer matrix not being available, and that the transfers had not been arbitrary. In his opinion, although the transfers had been prompted by a general instruction issued to CSC, the decisions had been made after an individualized assessment of all relevant factors. He concluded that they had not been made in the absence or in excess of jurisdiction. The applications forhabeas corpusandcertiorariin aid were then dismissed.  11The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: (2003), 188 B.C.A.C. 23, 2003 BCCA 536. On the jurisdiction issue, the Court of Appeal had asked for and received written submissions from counsel on the issue raised inSpindler v. Millhaven Institution(2003), 15 C.R. (6th) 183 (Ont. C.A.).  12InSpindler, prisoners had been placed in a maximum‑security prison as a result of a new policy applicable to convicted murderers. They raised arguments which were similar to the submissions of the appellants in the present appeals. The Ontario Court of Appeal had held that, where a remedy is available in the Federal Court on the exercise of a statutory power granted under a federal statute to a federally appointed individual or tribunal, the provincial superior court should decline to hear an application forhabeas corpusif no reasonable explanation for the failure to pursue judicial review in the Federal Court was offered by the petitioner. In doing so, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s decision inHickey v. Kent Institution (Director)(2003), 176 B.C.A.C. 272, 2003 BCCA 23.  13Ryan J.A. felt that those comments were particularly apt in the case at bar. Although the issues raised in these cases were not identical to those raised inSpindler, they all involved policies and procedures adopted by the Commissioner of Corrections in determining the security classifications of the appellants.  In her view, these cases should have been heard by the “specialized” Federal Court. The appellants had offered no reasonable explanation for failing to pursue judicial review in the Federal Court, so Ryan J.A. was of the opinion that Bauman J. ought to have declined to hear the applications in these cases, though it is implicit from her reasons that he had jurisdiction to do so. Nevertheless, Ryan J.A. decided to examine the substantive issue, but she found no error in Bauman J.’s conclusion that there were no procedural flaws which would entitle the appellants to an order forhabeas corpus.  14Since the Supreme Court of British Columbia heard the application, the record indicates that the situation of most of the appellants has changed. On June 30, 2002, Mr. May was transferred from medium- to minimum-security confinement at Ferndale Institution. On February 6, 2003, Mr. Speer-Senner was also transferred back to Ferndale Institution. On January 30, 2005, Mr. Owen was released on full parole.  The record is silent with respect to the updated situation of Mr. Roy, however, at the hearing, Ms. Pollack, one of the counsel for the appellants, informed us that only Mr. Robinson is still incarcerated in a medium-security institution.

            "7                                   In July 1997, with few leads to investigate but suspicious that Cory Grandinetti was involved, the RCMP began an undercover operation, Project Kilometer, in an attempt to obtain additional evidence against him.  Several police officers posed as members of a criminal organization and worked at winning Cory Grandinetti’s confidence.  Mr. Grandinetti thought the criminal enterprise he was dealing with was a large international organization involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.  He was led to believe that this organization was moving to Calgary, that he had been chosen as its Calgary contact, and that he could potentially make hundreds of thousands of dollars by participating in the organization’s criminal activities.",

In other words, it is the fear of reprisal or hope of leniency that persons in authority may hold out and which is associated with their official status that may render a statement involuntary. . . .  This limitation [i.e., the person in authority requirement] is appropriate since most criminal investigations are undertaken by the state, and it is then that an accused is most vulnerable to state coercion. [paras. 48 and 24]",
            "[R]eason and common sense dictates that when the cases speak of a person in authority as one who is capable of controlling or influencing the course of the proceedings, it is from the perspective of someone who is involved in the investigation, the apprehension and prosecution of a criminal offence resulting in a conviction, an agent of the police or someone working in collaboration with the police.  It does not include someone who seeks to sabotage the investigation or steer the investigation away from a suspect that the state is investigating.",
            "44                               The appellant believed that the undercover officers were criminals, not police officers, albeit criminals with corrupt police contacts who could potentially influence the investigation against him.  When, as in this case, the accused confesses to an undercover officer he thinks can influence his murder investigation by enlisting corrupt police officers, the state’s coercive power is not engaged.  The statements, therefore, were not made to a person in authority."

        "Facts": " 33Of course, the added words must be pertinent to the offence charged.  As Evans J.A. wrote inHarmer and Miller:  . . . the charge must be so worded that the accused is afforded reasonable notice of the offence or offences alleged to be included in the principal offence charged.  Moreover, the offence must be one which is properly included in the count. [p. 19]   34The question in this case is whether the Crown can bring sexual assault and/or sexual interference within any of the three categories of included offences.  F.Application of the Law to the Facts  35In my view, it cannot be said that the respondent in this case was fairly notified that in meeting the charge of incest he was also required to defend against sexual assault or sexual interference as “included” offences.  I would apply to this case what was said by Phillimore L.J. inR. v. Woods, [1969] 1 Q.B. 447 (C.A.), at p. 451:  It is of the first importance that a man charged with an offence should know with certainty what it is he may be convicted of.  No court should be encouraged to cast around to see whether somehow or other the words of the indictment can be found to contain by some arguable implication the seeds of some other offence.  36The fact of the matter is that the Crowncouldhave charged the respondent with sexual assault and sexual interference but in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion refrained from doing so.  On the facts of this case, the rules governing “included” offences do not provide a remedy for this omission.  37As to the first category, there is nothing in theCriminal Codethat explicitly makes sexual assault or sexual interference an offence included in incest.  38As to the second category, it cannot be said that incest as “described in the enactment creating it” includes sexual assault or sexual interference.  As discussed earlier, incest can be committed without any assault whatsoever.  Consent is no defence:S. (M.),F. (R.P.).  Nor must the victim be under fourteen years of age.  The five accused persons inF. (R.P.)were all adults.  The age of the complainant constitutes merely a factual circumstance which is irrelevant to whether or not the offence of incest is committed.  39As to the third category, it cannot be said that the wording of the count charging the respondent with incest described a sexual assault, or indeed gave any information from which an issue of non-consent could fairly be inferred, or suggested that the victim was underage and therefore was incapable of consenting.  It is true, of course, that an allegation of incest includes the allegation of a physical act which, if done without consent, would be an assault.  However, if the Crown wished to dispense with proof of non-consent by relying on s. 150.1(1), it was incumbent upon it to allege the factual condition precedent to the operation of s. 150.1(1), namely the fact that the victim was under fourteen years old.  This was not done.  The age of the victim would be for the Crown to prove, not for the defence to disprove.  To repeat, for ease of reference, the count in the indictment read in its entirety:  [translation]Between December 13, 1995 and May 31, 1999, at Québec in the district of Québec, did commit incest with C.R., knowing that person to be his daughter, thereby committing the indictable offence provided for insection 155(2)of theCriminal Code.  40The Crown says the evidence subsequently led in the case shows that commission of incest in this case would necessarily have involved the commission of sexual interference and a sexual assault due to the age of the daughter, and that the age of the daughter must have been within the knowledge of the respondent, but there is nothing in s. 662 that permits the Crown to supplement the allegations in the charge, or the elements of the enactment creating the offence, by reference to the personal knowledge of an accused.  41The corollary, to what I have said above however, is that acquittal on the charge of incest would not provide the respondent in these circumstances with a defence ofautrefois acquitto a charge of sexual assault or sexual interference.  The rule against double jeopardy requires that the accused at the earlier trial have been in jeopardy of conviction of the subsequent charge:Cullen v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 658, at p. 668;R. v. Rinnie, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 218 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.).  The respondent here was in no such jeopardy.  42Whether or not the Crown chooses to proceed with other charges against the respondent is for the Crown to decide. ",

            "On September 2, 2003, the Crown brought an ex parte application in open court in the Ontario Court of Justice for an order sealing the search warrants, the informations used to obtain the warrants and related documents.  The Crown claimed that public disclosure of the material could identify a confidential informant and could interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation.",
            "22                               These principles, as they apply in the criminal investigative context, were subsequently adopted by Parliament and codified in s. 487.3  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  That provision does not govern this case, since our concern here is with warrants issued under the Provincial Offences Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.  It nonetheless provides a useful reference point since it encapsulates in statutory form the common law that governs, in the absence of valid legislation to the contrary, throughout Canada.",
            "23                               Section 487.3(2) is of particular relevance to this case.  It contemplates a sealing order on the ground that the ends of justice would be subverted, in that disclosure of the information would compromise the nature and extent of an ongoing investigation.  That is what the Crown argued here.  It is doubtless a proper ground for a sealing order with respect to an information used to obtain a provincial warrant and not only to informations under the Criminal Code .  In either case, however, the ground must not just be asserted in the abstract; it must be supported by particularized grounds related to the investigation that is said to be imperilled.  And that, as we shall see, is what Doherty J.A. found to be lacking here.",
            "While the test was developed in the context of publication bans, it is equally applicable to all discretionary actions by a trial judge to limit freedom of expression by the press during judicial proceedings.  Discretion must be exercised in accordance with the Charter , whether it arises under the common law, as is the case with a publication ban . . .; is authorized by statute, for example under s. 486(1)  of the Criminal Code  which allows the exclusion of the public from judicial proceedings in certain circumstances (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [[1996] 3 S.C.R. 480], at para. 69); or under rules of court, for example, a confidentiality order (Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522, 2002 SCC 41).",
            "39                               Second, Doherty J.A. found that the affiant’s concern, for which he offered no specific basis, amounted to a mere assertion that “the police might have an advantage in questioning some individuals if those individuals [are] unaware of the details of the police investigation” (para. 27).  In oral argument before this Court, counsel for the Crown referred to this as the “advantage of surprise”.  In this regard, Doherty J.A. noted Iacobucci J.’s conclusion in Mentuck, at para. 34, that access to court documents cannot be denied solely for the purpose of giving law enforcement officers an investigative advantage; rather, the party seeking confidentiality must at the very least allege a serious and specific risk to the integrity of the criminal investigation."

The extent to which it becomes a necessary adjunct to the right to make full answer and defence depends on the context.  The Garofoli threshold test requires that the defence show a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination of the affiant will elicit testimony of probative value to the issue for consideration by the reviewing judge.  It is grounded in two basic principles of evidence:  relevance and materiality.  It is also born out of concerns about the prolixity of proceedings and, in many cases, the need to protect the identity of informants.  The rule does not infringe the right to make full answer and defence.  There is no constitutional right to adduce irrelevant or immaterial evidence.

C-46 ),  was consonant with the rights guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter .  However, the Court held that the interception of private communications by the state, with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof but without prior judicial authorization, infringed s. 8.  In response to Duarte, s. 184.2 was enacted permitting the interception of private communications with the consent of a participant under judicial authorization.  As will be discussed later, the authorization in this case was obtained under s. 184.2.  The appellants challenged the constitutionality of s. 184.2 at trial; the trial judge rejected their argument and his ruling was not challenged on appeal.",
            "The review is based on the documents relating to the authorization (available to the defence upon request under s. 187(1.4)  of the Criminal Code ) and the submissions of counsel.  Further evidence may be adduced at the review hearing.  If the reviewing judge concludes that, on the material before the authorizing judge as amplified by any evidence taken on review, there was no basis upon which the authorizing judge could be satisfied that the preconditions for the granting of the authorization existed, the reviewing judge will conclude that the search or seizure contravened s. 8  of the Charter .  The review is not a hearing de novo.  The proper standard of review was explained in Garofoli as follows:",
            "3.1.1    Have the 1993 Criminal Code Amendments Changed the Legal Landscape?",
            "12                               First, the appellants contend that the current regime under Part VI of the Criminal Code  is “quite different” from the statutory scheme that was in place when Garofoli was decided.  Under the previous statutory scheme, the general rule in respect of wiretap evidence was exclusionary.  The evidence was inadmissible unless the Crown could bring it within one of the statutory exceptions and show that “the interception was lawfully made”.  Hence, if the wiretap did not meet the statutory preconditions, the evidence could not be admitted against the accused.  Under the present regime, it is the accused who bears the burden on a s. 24  Charter  application of  proving that his rights were violated and the remedy, rather than being an automatic exclusion, is left to be determined under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The appellants argue that the repeal of the former exclusionary rule has effectively shifted the onus in relation to the admissibility of wiretap evidence from the Crown to the accused.  Hence they submit that under the current statutory scheme, where the accused bears the onus of proof, it is inconsistent with the right to make full answer and defence that the accused also bear an evidentiary burden to demonstrate that the cross-examination of the affiant on the supporting affidavit is necessary.",
            "14                               The repeal of the “lawful interception” statutory precondition to the admissibility of the intercepted communications removed the need for the Crown to prove two of the three matters which had been the subject of the Parsons voir dire:  the facial validity of the authorization, and whether it had been implemented in accordance with its terms (see Garofoli, p. 1445).  (The obligation to prove reasonable notice of the intention to introduce the evidence remains by virtue of s. 189(5)  of the Criminal Code .)",
            "15                               Insofar as the facial validity of the authorization is concerned, the 1993  amendments have no real practical effect on the accused’s onus.  The first question to be determined on a Charter  challenge is whether the search is authorized by law.  In order to answer this question, the reviewing judge must determine whether the Criminal Code  provisions have been satisfied.  While the accused bears the onus of proving the alleged Charter  violation, in answer to the accused’s challenge, the evidentiary burden of producing a facially valid authorization will inevitably remain on the Crown, failing which the accused will have met his persuasive burden on this point with ease.",
            "19                               I therefore conclude that the appellants’ contention that the 1993 amendments to the Criminal Code  had “a significant and lasting impact on the ability of accused persons to challenge the sub-facial validity of wiretap authorizations” cannot be accepted.",
            "20                               Second, the appellants contend that the ex parte and in camera wiretap authorization process lacks sufficient procedural safeguards and that the procedure in Part VI of the Criminal Code  (containing the provisions on invasion of privacy) does not strike the appropriate balance between the individual’s privacy interest and the public’s interest in crime detection.  Hence, they submit that allowing an applicant to cross-examine, as a matter of right, the deponent of an affidavit filed in support of the wiretap authorization would provide a further counterbalance and enhance the appearance of fairness.",
            "24                               There is no debate that these important principles are relevant both in the formulation of an appropriate standard for allowing cross-examination and in its application.  However, the accused’s right to an evidentiary hearing must be considered in context.  It must also be balanced against countervailing interests, including the need to ensure that the criminal trial process is not plagued by lengthy proceedings that do not assist in the determination of the relevant issues.  As I will explain, the appellants’ argument ignores important contextual factors.  When the proposed cross-examination of an affiant is considered in the context of the review hearing and its narrow scope, it is my view that the Garofoli leave requirement strikes an appropriate balance between these competing interests.",
            "25                               The first contextual factor that is ignored by the appellants’ argument has already been mentioned — the right to full disclosure.  Under s. 187(1.4)  of the Criminal Code , the defence has access to all the documents relating to the authorization.  Access is granted on the simple assertion that the admissibility of the evidence is challenged and that access to the material is required in preparation for trial:  Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505, at p. 1517.  The material includes the affidavit filed in support of the application for an authorization.  Subject to any necessary editing for the protection of informants, the affidavit will usually provide a comprehensive account of the investigation leading up to the wiretap application, an articulation of the grounds relied upon in support of the application, and information relevant to the reasonable believability of material gathered from informants.  The affidavit filed in this case will be reviewed in detail later in these reasons.",
            "The Supreme Court of Canada and appellate courts across Canada have been attempting in recent years to restrict the issues that go to a jury to those which have, on the evidence, an air of reality to them.  Just as we have tried to restrict the trial of an accused on the merits to factual issues that are directly raised in the particular case, so should we strive to restrict pre-trial Charter  motions to matters of substance where defence counsel can establish some basis for a violation of a right.  Unless we, as courts, can find some method of rescuing our criminal trial process from the almost Dickensian procedural morass that it is now bogged down in, the public will lose patience with our traditional adversarial system of justice.  As Jonathan Swift might have said, we are presently sacrificing justice on the shrine of process. [p. 440]",
            "37                               Finally, as aptly argued by the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia, a requirement that the defence meet a threshold test of some sort before engaging in cross-examination, pursuing a specific line of inquiry, or eliciting evidence in support of a full answer and defence is not an anomaly within the criminal justice system.  To state but a few examples:  hearsay evidence, although sought to be elicited by the defence, must meet the requirements of necessity and reliability; proposed expert evidence must meet the criteria set out in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; access to or cross-examination on matters protected by solicitor-client privilege must meet the requirements of the “innocence at stake” exception; cross-examination on a complainant’s sexual history is prohibited unless it meets the test under s. 276(1)  of the Criminal Code ; third-party records in respect of certain offences listed under s. 278.2 must be shown to be likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify before they will be produced; defences must have an “air of reality” to them before they are put to the jury.  In this case, the defence must simply make a show of likely relevance on a material issue before the court.",
            "In short, the appellant showed a basis for the view that the cross-examination would elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence of one of the pre-conditions to the authorization, namely the investigative necessity requirement. Investigative necessity is a stringent requirement, requiring demonstration that there is, “practically speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry” (emphasis in original):  R. v. Araujo (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), at para. 29.  There was a basis for believing that this exacting standard had not been met.  The same might be said here of the use of the undercover officers and police agents. [para. 14]",
            "49                               The appellants were charged with a number of drug-related offences.  In essence, the Crown alleged that they distributed cocaine to doormen and bartenders at various bars and clubs in downtown Vancouver.  The appellants were targeted by the police when Robert Molsberry, a self-admitted drug dealer and petty criminal who had been a doorman at a Vancouver club, complained to members of the Vancouver Police that the appellants and others were after him over unpaid drug debts and that he feared for his safety.  Molsberry agreed to “wear a wire” and act as police agent.  In return for his cooperation, he was given $1,000 by the Vancouver Police Department to satisfy the drug debt and promised a monthly stipend during the investigation, a cash payment at the conclusion of all proceedings, and entry into the witness protection program.",
            "50                               Based on their agreement with Molsberry, the police applied for a consent wiretap authorization under s. 184.2  of the Criminal Code .  This provision was enacted in response to this Court’s decision in Duarte and permits the interception of private communications with the consent of a participant under judicial authorization.  An application under this section may be made ex parte by a peace officer on the strength of an affidavit deposing to the following matters:"

            "6                 The trial judge also erred by failing to instruct the jury on the provisions of s. 41  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , in respect of the defence of house or property. While an intentional shooting could not be justified on this basis, Mr. Gunning never advanced this defence in respect of the shooting. Rather, the defence was advanced in respect of the use of the firearm, prior and up to what he alleged to have been an accidental shooting. On the evidence, this defence raised a real issue for the jury to decide. Rather than limiting his inquiry to the threshold question of whether the defence had any evidential foundation, the trial judge effectively determined the merits of the defence. In doing so, he again exceeded his proper function.",
            "14               In response to the trial judge’s comments, counsel argued further that there was a question for the jury to decide: whether, in all the circumstances, Mr. Gunning’s conduct in taking the gun, loading it in his own home and exposing it to somebody was “without lawful excuse” within the meaning of the Criminal Code  definition of the offence of careless use of a firearm. The trial judge rejected this argument, stating as follows:",

What I consider a reasonable conclusion on the facts is only me, it isn’t necessarily decisive on you. There is a concept in our law, believe it or not, that there is the privilege on the part of a jury to reach a perverse verdict. In other words, that they may come to a completely different conclusion on the facts than I might or that I might think any reasonable person might, and because a jury’s deliberations are theirs alone and secret, of course we can’t inquire into that. So that’s what that’s all about. ",

        "Facts": " 24Mr. Boucher’s defence was that, given what he had consumed, his blood alcohol level could not have been the level recorded by the breathalyzer test.  He disputed the accuracy of the test and challenged the presumption set out in s. 258(1)(g)Cr. C.Although the expert tacitly alluded to the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c)Cr. C.in saying that, if the alcohol had been consumed in the minutes preceding the breathalyzer test, the level recorded by the test might not have been the same as the level at the time Boucher was stopped, this was not the defence theory.  Rothman J.A. was correct to say that the case concerned the nature of the evidence to the contrary required to rebut the presumption of accuracy, but the parties and the judges were wrong to refer to s. 258(1)(c)Cr. C.  The question is therefore whether Mr. Boucher adduced evidence to the contrary that raised a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the breathalyzer results.  25Rothman J.A. found that the Municipal Court judge had failed to consider the evidence as a whole as required byW. (D.).  In that case, this Court suggested an approach for determining whether guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt in cases where credibility is in question.  That clarification was needed because the trial judge had told the jurors that, to reach a verdict, they had to decide whether they believed the defence evidence or the Crown’s evidence.  This charge was incorrect because it excluded a third possibility:  that the jury could still have a reasonable doubt either because of the accused’s testimony or in light of the evidence as a whole (p. 757).  The instructions proposed in that case were as follows (at p. 758):  (1)   if the testimony of the accused is believed, the accused must be acquitted;  (2)   if the testimony of the accused is not believed but there is still a reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted;  (3)   even if the testimony does not raise any doubt, the jurors must still ask themselves whether, on the basis of all the evidence that they do accept, they are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.  26In the case at bar, the trier of fact did not believe the respondent and found that he had adduced no evidence to the contrary.  The Superior Court judge reversed the trial judgment, not on the basis of credibility, as he had been asked to do, but because he found that the judge had erred with respect to the standard of proof required to rebut the presumption.  He was of the opinion that the evidence as a whole could raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused’s blood alcohol level exceeded the permissible limit at the time of the arrest (para. 23).  I myself do not think that the trier of fact committed an error that warrants intervention.  27In assessing the consequences of rejecting Mr. Boucher’s testimony, I will begin by accepting the trier of fact’s finding on credibility, and will then explain why there is no reason to intervene on the question of credibility.  2.1Consequences of Rejecting Mr. Boucher’s Testimony  28What are the consequences of rejecting Mr. Boucher’s testimony?  According toProudlock, “if the trier of fact does not believe the evidence so tendered, the statutory presumption operates” in the absence of any other evidence (p. 542).  Or as Fish J.A., as he then was, stated inR. v. Dubois(1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Que. C.A.):  “Evidence to the contrary” that isdisbelievedwill, of course, fail to neutralize, or to render inoperative, the presumption created by s. 258(1)(c) of theCode. [Emphasis in original; p. 92.]  29With respect, the case at bar was not one to whichW. (D.)applied.  To neutralize the presumption, the judge needed only to have a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the breathalyzer result.  The approach set out inW. (D.)is not a sacrosanct formula that serves as a straitjacket for trial courts.  Trial judges deliver oral judgments every day and often limit their reasons to the essential points.  It would be wrong to require them to explain in detail the process they followed to reach a verdict.  They need only give reasons that the parties can understand and that permit appellate review:R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, 2002 SCC 26, andR. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656.  In the instant case, the judge, by stating that she did not believe Mr. Boucher, was implicitly addressing the first two steps inW. (D.).  30What evidence other than Mr. Boucher’s testimony, which was rejected, could have been taken into consideration?  The expert’s evidence could have been, according to the Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. of the Court of Appeal.  31The expert’s opinion about the blood alcohol level the breathalyzer test should have shown was based on Mr. Boucher’s testimony.  The expert did not evaluate Mr. Boucher’s resistance to alcohol.  He simply provided average figures relating to the blood alcohol level of a 28‑year‑old man who weighs 175 pounds and is 5'11\" tall and who consumes 44 ounces of beer containing five percent alcohol over a period of two to three hours.  If a judge does not believe that an accused consumed 44 ounces of beer, the expert’s calculation is of no help.  Such evidence merely provides theoretical information that differs from the facts on which judgment was based.  If the expert evidence is based on the accused’s testimony and the accused’s testimony is not believed, the expert’s evidence cannot assist the court or constitute evidence to the contrary.  What else is left?  32The Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. were of the opinion that the absence of symptoms other than the smell of alcohol was also a factor that could raise a reasonable doubt.  Forget J.A., on the other hand, was of the opinion that this was a neutral factor.  He was correct, in my view.  33Evidence that there are no symptoms is indeed very relevant to the charge of impaired driving.  In fact, this explains why, when the prosecution closed its case, it asked the judge to acquit Mr. Boucher on that charge.  The situation is quite different for the charge of driving with a blood alcohol level over 80 mg.  The offence of driving with a level exceeding 80 mg does not require proof of impairment.  The absence of symptoms of impairment is generally not sufficient to constitute evidence to the contrary that can be used to rebut the presumption of accuracy.  This is because a lack of evidence of the usual symptoms of impairment, such as staggering and slurred speech, does not provide information about the actual blood alcohol level.  Symptoms such as these usually accompany extremely high blood alcohol levels.  Conversely, very low levels are generally consistent with an absence of symptoms.  An absence of symptoms is therefore not significant in itself if the court does not know the accused’s level of alcohol tolerance.  34The expert who testified in this case has not enlightened the Court about Mr. Boucher’s alcohol tolerance.  He relied on statistical averages.  By definition, the reason there are averages is that not everyone who consumes alcohol reacts in the same way.  The level of alcohol tolerance is not a matter for judicial notice, particularly when the case does not involve extremely high levels.  The difference of opinion between two judges of the Court of Appeal on this point is certainly indicative of a need to rely on the usual methods of proof in this regard.  Like Forget J.A., I agree with the following statement by Charron J.A., as she then was, inLatour:  Second, and more importantly, this evidence is not capable of constituting “evidence to the contrary”.  Even accepting as a fact that a “normal, average” person with the same breathalyser readings should exhibit stronger indicia of impairment than that observed in the respondent, this fact is of no consequence in the absence of evidence on the respondent’s tolerance to alcohol.  This opinion evidence, as presented, without any connection to the respondent, is merely speculative and of no evidentiary value. [para. 14]  35Mr. Boucher’s testimony, the expert evidence and the absence of the usual symptoms of intoxication (except the smell of alcohol) were not evidence to the contrary.  What other evidence constituted evidence to the contrary?  In the opinion of Rothman J.A., the low level recorded by the breathalyzer test was another factor that could raise a reasonable doubt.  But I find it difficult to see how the fact that the alcohol levels were 93 mg and 92 mg (which Rothman J.A. characterized as low) could constitute evidence that the breathalyzer result was inaccurate.  How can the results of 93 mg and 92 mg show that the result itself was inaccurate?  The result is precisely the figure that the accused claimed was inaccurate.  To achieve his goal, he should logically have tried to discredit that figure, not to use it.  The result cannot be both evidence and evidence contrary to that evidence.  36The Municipal Court judge stated that, because she did not believe Mr. Boucher, the expert evidence was not evidence to the contrary.  This statement implied that, of all the evidence she had heard, only the expert evidence would have been capable of constituting evidence to the contrary if it had had any basis.  To reach that conclusion, she must necessarily have assessed the evidence as a whole.  In my opinion, the Superior Court judge and Rothman J.A. could not reproach her for failing to consider the evidence as a whole.  37In short, unless Mr. Boucher’s testimony is reassessed and given a different weight than the trial judge gave it, I see nothing that the trial judge rejected that she should have taken into consideration to find that there was a reasonable doubt.  38I will make one further comment on the expert’s testimony about the difference in the levels, attributable to the absorption time, between the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed and the time of the test.  This evidence was adduced as evidence to the contrary in relation to the presumption of identity.  It is relevant to recall that the argument to which the expert alluded is not a new one.  It was made inSt. Pierre, and this Court rejected it:  If any evidence of difference between the accused’s blood alcohol level at the time of the testing and at the time of the driving could be considered “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of s. 258(1)(c) so as to rebut the presumption, then the presumption could be rebutted in every case.  The simple reason for this is that an intoxicated person’s blood alcohol level is constantly changing as a result of absorption and elimination of alcohol into and out of the blood.  A person charged with “over 80” could simply show that his blood alcohol level changed between driving and being stopped because some of the alcohol had been metabolized in the interim, and suddenly the presumption in s. 258(1)(c) would be gone. . . .  If this normal process of absorption and elimination were considered to be “evidence to the contrary”, then the presumption would be useless, since it could always be rebutted.  . . .

Third, s. 487.055 applies to three classes of offenders who have been convicted and sentenced prior to the proclamation of the DNA Identification Act :  (a) persons already declared to be “dangerous offenders”; (b) persons convicted of “more than one murder committed at different times”; and (c) persons convicted of “more than one sexual offence” and who, on the date of the application, are still serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for one or more of those offences.  (The list of targeted offenders has since been expanded by deleting the requirement that there be “more than one murder committed at different times” and by including dangerous sexual offenders and persons convicted of manslaughter who, on the date of the application, are still serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for that offence (S.C. 2005, c. 25, s. 5).)  Only s. 487.055, the retrospective provision, is in issue on this appeal.  However, the alleged s. 8 constitutional deficiency — the absence of reasonable and probable grounds linking the convicted offender to a particular investigation — is equally present in all three provisions."

In light of the legislative scheme and the Board’s mandate discussed above, how should these conditions be characterized? As valid requests for information under the Board’s supervisory powers, or as an invalid interference with the Director’s treatment decisions? I am of the view that all three conditions constitute valid exercises of the Board’s power to request information for the assessment and management of Mazzei’s safety risk, and its power to supervise his treatment, including the scrutiny of past approaches and the exploration of alternatives. Furthermore, all three conditions were “reasonable” given the circumstances of this case and the evidence before the Board at Mazzei’s hearing.  5.1Jurisdiction to Impose the Conditions ",

        "Facts": " 5The appellant operated a club in Montréal, called L’Orage.  The purpose of the club was to permit couples and single people to meet each other for group sex. Only members and their guests were admitted to the club.  Prospective members were interviewed to ensure that they were aware of the nature of the activities of the club and to exclude applicants who did not share the same views on group sex.  Members paid an annual membership fee.  6At the time of the events giving rise to the charge against the appellant, the club L’Orage had three floors.  The first floor was occupied by a bar, the second a salon, and the third the “apartment” of the appellant.  A doorman manned the main door of the club, to ensure that only members and their guests entered.  Two doors  separated access to the third floor apartment from the rest of the club.  One was marked “Privé” (Private) and the other locked with a numeric key pad.  7Members of the club were supplied with the appropriate code and permitted to access the third floor apartment.  This was the only place where group sex took place.  A number of mattresses were scattered about the floor of the apartment.  There people engaged in acts of cunnilingus, masturbation, fellatio and penetration.  On several occasions observed by the police, a single woman engaged in sex with several men, while other men watched and masturbated.  8Entry to the club and participation in the activities were voluntary.  No one was forced to do anything or watch anything.  No one was paid for sex.  While men considerably outnumbered women on the occasions when the police visited, there is no suggestion that any of the women were there involuntarily or that they did not willingly engage in the acts of group sex.

        "Facts": " 2.1R. v. B.W.P.  7B.W.P., an aboriginal young person, pled guilty to manslaughter and to an unrelated offence of theft.  The theft charge related to stolen speakers and is not relevant to this appeal.  The charge of manslaughter arose out of a fight between B.W.P. and Saleh, a 22-year-old refugee from Iraq.  The fight started when B.W.P., who was intoxicated at the time, asked Saleh why he was staring at the two women who were with B.W.P. Saleh thereupon exited his vehicle and challenged B.W.P. to fight.  During the course of the fight, B.W.P. swung a stocking-covered pool ball hitting Saleh’s head two or three times.  Saleh was able to drive away, but died from his head injuries a short time later.  With no family members residing in Canada, Saleh’s body was returned to Iraq for burial.  Attempts to contact members of the family were unsuccessful and no victim impact statement was available at the sentence hearing.  Considerable evidence was called concerning B.W.P.’s background and character including a transfer report, a pre-sentence report,  psychological assessment reports and youth bail management reports.  8Although charged under theYoung Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1(“YOA”), B.W.P. was sentenced under theYCJA.  Meyers Prov. Ct. J., for the Winnipeg Youth Justice Court, first held that the offence of manslaughter is a “serious violent offence” within the meaning ofs. 2of theYCJAand then turned to a consideration of the appropriate sentence: (2003), 176 Man. R. (2d) 218.  After reviewing the guiding principles and purposes of sentencing found inss. 3(1), 38 and39, the provisions ofs. 50(1)of theYCJAon the limited applicability of Part XXIII of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and the relevant jurisprudence, the sentencing judge concluded that general deterrence is not consistent with the new sentencing philosophy under theYCJA.  9The sentencing judge reviewed the evidence concerning the offender, noting in particular B.W.P.’s supportive and stable family, aboriginal identity, minimal legal record, positive school attendance and performance, pro-social extracurricular activities and the positive comments from family members, school officials and hockey coaches.  The sentencing judge also relied on the psychological assessment by Dr. Somers who found the risk of re-offending to be low and unlikely to be reduced by a period of custody, recommending rather that B.W.P. be maintained in the community.  The sentencing judge held as follows:  The purpose of sentencing under theYouth Criminal Justice Actis to provide just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the offender and promote his rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.  That rehabilitation and reintegration has been well underway since BWP’s release from custody in December 2001.  Except for one misstep for which he paid dearly by serving a period of time in custody while awaiting disposition, his march towards becoming a law-abiding member of the community has been most positive. . . .  Separating BWP from society as urged by the Crown will in my opinion not address the long-term protection of the public as envisioned by theYouth Criminal Justice Act.  However, allowing him to build on the progress he has made since his release from custody would meet that goal.  [paras. 78 and 86]  10Meyers Prov. Ct. J. disagreed with the Crown’s position that ss. 42(2)(n) and 42(2)(o) must be read in tandem so as to require the court to impose two-thirds of the sentence in custody and one-third under supervision.  Rather, he took the view that s. 42(2)(o) gave him the discretion to determine the appropriate length of the custody and supervision portions of the sentence.  He therefore sentenced B.W.P. to a 15-month custody and supervision order, in addition to the 108 days spent in pre-trial custody.   He directed that B.W.P. serve one day in open custody and the remainder of the 15 months under conditional supervision in the community subject to 18 listed conditions, to be followed by a one-year supervised probation order subject to less restrictive conditions.  11The Crown appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, arguing that the youth court judge erred in finding that general deterrence was not consistent with the  philosophy of theYCJA.  The Crown argued further that the sentencing judge erred by refusing to read s. 42(2)(o) in tandem with s. 42(2)(n) which requires that the supervision portion of the order be “one half as long” as the custody portion.  Hamilton J.A., writing for the Manitoba Court of Appeal, affirmed the sentencing judge’s decision and dismissed the appeal: (2004), 187 Man. R. (2d) 80, 2004 MBCA 110.  12On the first issue, Hamilton J.A. gave careful consideration to the Crown’s argument that this Court’s decision inR. v. M. (J.J.), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421, continues to apply and considered the conflicting jurisprudence on this point.  She concluded that deterrence is not a principle for sentencing young persons under theYCJA:  Under theYOA, the protection of society and the public was an important principle.  While the long‑term protection of the public and respect for societal values remains important under theYCJA, Parliament has directed that this is achieved through rehabilitation, reintegration and accountability wherever possible. As Gorman, P.J., noted inC.M.P., the sentence of a young person is “individualistic” with a primary emphasis on rehabilitation.  When I consider the wording of s. 50(1) in the context of the overall principles of theYCJA, I agree with those judges, like Werier, P.J., inA.E.B., and the sentencing judge here, who have ruled that deterrence is not to be considered when sentencing a young person.  A judge cannot sentence one young person with the aim of sending a message to other youth.  This would be at variance with the required focus on the young person being sentenced.  I am also of the view that specific deterrence is not a principle of sentencing in light of the exclusion of this principle unders. 50(1)of theYCJA.  Having said that, the sentence, and the judicial process itself, may very well have a deterrent effect on the young person and others.  [para. 64]   13On the second issue, Hamilton J.A. held that the sentencing judge had properly concluded that s. 42(2)(o) gives a wider discretion than does s. 42(2)(n):  The sentencing judge was correct to distinguish between subs. 42(2)(n) and 42(2)(o).  I agree with counsel for B.W.P. that the ordinary meaning of s. 42(2)(o) is clear from its words and its context.  A custody and supervision order under s. 42(2)(o) is but one of 18 sanctions that a sentencing judge may consider.  It is different from subs. (n) and gives the judge broader discretion with respect to how long (or short) the custody period and community supervision period will be.  Because s. 42(2)(o) only applies to presumptive offences, this broader discretion allows for the sentencing judge to increase the time in custody for these serious offences.  However, this discretion does not preclude the judge from favouring the supervision period of the order, as the sentencing judge obviously did in this case.  This discretion is consistent with the primary purpose of theYCJAto promote rehabilitation, reintegration and accountability through, wherever possible, non‑custodial sentences.  [para. 73]  14The Crown appeals to this Court on the same two grounds.  2.2R. v. B.V.N.  15B.V.N. pled guilty to the offence of aggravated assault causing bodily harm.   The charge arose out of B.V.N.’s activities as a drug dealer.  A few days before the assault in question, B.V.N. and an associate accosted the complainant — a drug addict — over a drug debt, held a gun to his head, clicking the trigger several times, forced him into a car and took him to a relative’s house to get money.  That incident ended when the relative phoned the police, forcing B.V.N. and his associate to flee.  A few days later, B.V.N. and his associate again accosted the complainant, threatened, punched,  kicked and stabbed him.  The complainant spent several days in the hospital.  16The evidence about the offender revealed a very unfortunate family background, no prior convictions for violent offences, but a history of suspension and expulsion from school for assault and drug trafficking, numerous problems in group homes, including threatening staff members, and possessions of weapons.  A psychiatric report put him at high risk of engaging in serious and violent criminal activity.  17On the question of general deterrence, the sentencing judge compared the provisions of theYCJAwith the formerYOAand concluded that general deterrence is one factor, albeit a minor one, in determining the appropriate sentence under the new regime.  Considering the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the sentencing judge imposed a nine-month custody and supervision order under s. 42(2)(n) (in addition to 81 days of pre-trial custody), with the custodial part of the order to be spent in closed custody: [2004] B.C.J. No. 153 (QL), 2004 BCPC 22.  18B.V.N. appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, arguing, among other grounds, that the sentencing judge erred in relying on the principle of general deterrence.  Mackenzie J.A., Lambert J.A. concurring, disagreed, finding that this Court’s decision inM. (J.J.)decided under theYOAremained good law: (2004), 196 B.C.A.C. 100, 2004 BCCA 266.  Although theYCJAprovides more detailed guidance for sentencing and is intended to reduce reliance on incarceration, it did not expressly exclude deterrence as a factor.  Mackenzie J.A. noted however that, as he read the reasons of the sentencing judge, “the element of general deterrence did not increase the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed” (para. 15).  The appeal was allowed in part, deleting certain conditions that have no relevance here.  Oppal J.A., in concurring reasons, agreed that the principle of general deterrence is still applicable,albeiton a somewhat more limited basis.  B.V.N. appeals to this Court, arguing that the courts below fell into error in considering general deterrence as a relevant factor and submitting that a different result would have been reached had this error not been made.

            "1                                   The Crown appeals from the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal overturning Mr. Kouri’s conviction of keeping a “common bawdy-house” for the “practice of acts of indecency” under s. 210(1)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  The appeal was heard together with R. v. Labaye, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 728, 2005 SCC 80.  Both cases require elaborating the  test for criminal indecency and applying it to the operation of clubs established to facilitate the practice of group sex activities. A more detailed discussion of the test for criminal indecency can be found in the companion case of Labaye.  Following its application to the present set of facts, I conclude that the acts alleged were not indecent, and that the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal acquitting the respondent should be affirmed.",
            "3                                   “Cœur à Corps” had been in existence as a meeting place for liberated couples since 1985.  It was only in 1996 that the police received a complaint and started an investigation into the potential commission of indecent acts.  Undercover police officers attended at the bar five times between September and November 1996, and on three further occasions between January and March 1997.  Two search warrants were issued and executed on the premises on November 16, 1996 and March 16, 1997, at which times the police arrested 62 and 95 persons, respectively, including both clients and employees.  The respondent was charged with two counts of keeping a bawdy-house contrary to s. 210(1)  of the Criminal Code .",
            "6                                   The main issue at trial was whether the respondent had the requisite mens rea, or criminal intent, to be found guilty of keeping a bawdy-house.  On the issue of indecency, the trial judge, following a review of the case law, simply stated that  [translation]  “[t]he defence has not argued this notion and the Court easily comes to the conclusion in this case that these are indecent acts committed in a public place in the sense of sections 150  and 197  of the Criminal Code ” (Mun. Ct. Mtl., No. 197 044 886, June 14, 2000, at p. 9).  On the issue of mens rea, he found that Mr. Kouri had been wilfully blind as to the indecent activities going on in his establishment, and that this sufficed to support a conviction.",
            "7                                   The majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction, on the ground that the acts at issue did not constitute criminal indecency ((2004), 191 C.C.C. (3d) 42).  Otis J.A. concluded that only activities posing an objective risk of social harm should be penalized and the sexual activities in this case did not give rise to such a risk.  While they were conducted in a public place, this was [translation] “one where access was restricted and reserved for this purpose, without anyone being compelled to participate or to witness the sexual acts, nor to be used as a sexual object for the gratification of others” (para. 47).",
            "4.1  The Test for Criminal Indecency",
            "9                                   As more fully discussed in the companion case of Labaye, Canadian law does not reduce indecency to what a judge views as morally corrupt.  The law has evolved toward an objective test of indecency based on the community standard of tolerance, which, in turn, has come to depend on the risk of harm entailed by the impugned activities.  Criminal sanction should only attach to render obscene or indecent materials or acts that create a significant risk of harm, incompatible with the proper functioning of society.",
            "10                               The present appeals require an elaboration of the structure of the inquiry in finding criminal indecency. Based on the guidelines emerging from R. v. Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, the analysis should proceed in two steps.  Indecent criminal conduct will be established where the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt the following two requirements:",
            "15                               The question at this stage is therefore whether the evidence establishes a significant risk of harm to the autonomy and liberty of members of the public.  This requires a contextual assessment of the risk of harm to those who may be involuntarily confronted with this conduct.  The control mechanisms designed to put people on notice and ensure an informed choice to enter the premises are vital to this assessment.  The question is whether they adequately restricted access to people informed about the nature of the place and willing to observe or participate in the activities taking place therein. In order to show that acts are indecent, the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the control mechanisms were insufficient to ward off the risk of unwanted exposure. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the evidence in this case falls below the required criminal standard of proof.",
            "23                               Finally, there is no suggestion of physical or psychological harm to the participants.  Again, the only apparent concern is the health risk from engaging in these activities without adequate protection.  However, as discussed in Labaye, this type of risk is conceptually and causally unrelated to indecency and cannot be an independent basis for a finding of criminal indecency.",
            "24                               The absence of proof of harm or significant risk of harm makes it unnecessary to discuss the subsequent step of the inquiry into criminal indecency.  I merely note that this is not a case of effectively removing the possibility of choice on the part of others as to how they go about their daily business without interference from what they see as deeply offensive conduct.  Given this degree of choice, it is difficult to see how the activities at the club can be seen to have caused harm incompatible with the proper functioning of society.",
            "26                               This appeal has been brought to determine whether the impugned sexual acts were indecent and whether the respondent was guilty of keeping a common bawdy‑house within the meaning of s. 210(1)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46  (“Cr. C.”)."

        "Facts": " 2The respondent operated a licensed bar called “Cœur à Corps”, on the first floor of a building in Montréal-Nord.  The second floor was occupied by a strip club, “Cabaret Chez Mado”, also owned by the respondent. “Cœur à Corps” was advertised in theJournal de Montréalas a meeting place for [translation] “liberated couples only”, but no further details were given as to the nature of the bar and the activities taking place therein.  A similar advertisement on the Internet described the atmosphere of the bar as “warm and cozy”.  3“Cœur à Corps” had been in existence as a meeting place for liberated couples since 1985.  It was only in 1996 that the police received a complaint and started an investigation into the potential commission of indecent acts.  Undercover police officers attended at the bar five times between September and November 1996, and on three further occasions between January and March 1997.  Two search warrants were issued and executed on the premises on November 16, 1996 and March 16, 1997, at which times the police arrested 62 and 95 persons, respectively, including both clients and employees.  The respondent was charged with two counts of keeping a bawdy-house contrary tos. 210(1)of theCriminal Code.  4According to the evidence at trial, access to the bar was only open to couples and a doorman asked prospective clients if they were a “liberated couple”.  If the couple answered yes, they were permitted to enter after paying a $6 fee.  The establishment had both a seating area and a dance floor.  Every half hour, a black, translucent curtain closed around the dance floor while slow music played for 8 to 12 minutes.  At these times, up to 70 people, comprising almost 80 percent of the clientele, would be on the dance floor engaging in group sex activities.  These included sexual caresses, masturbation, fellatio and penetration.  While the curtain served to separate the dance floor from the rest of the premises, it did not prevent observation of the sexual activities from the seating area.  5There was no specific evidence that anyone entered the bar not knowing what to expect.  The manager of the club, Mr. Lacroix, testified that he would not admit any couple who did not confirm that they were a liberated couple or any couple who were simply curious as to what was going on inside. He further stated that he gave orders to this effect to the doorman, when he was not himself present at the door.  At the same time, the testimony left open the possibility that there might have been exceptions to this practice.  Mr. Lacroix in fact indicated that he had not asked the undercover police officers if they were a liberated couple, but knew that they had come to the bar twice.  Once inside, the police officers observed one incident where a woman became angry with her partner and the couple left the premises shortly thereafter.  Apart from this incident, there is no further suggestion that anyone was unwillingly or unwittingly exposed to the acts committed in the club.

Three more masked men then emerged, but without weapons. The last three assailants grabbed the complainant’s arms, seized the pizza and took Mr. Saleem’s money and receipts from his pockets.  Two of them took Mr. Saleem into the stairwell where they bound his hands and stuffed a cloth in his mouth.  They removed Mr. Saleem’s wallet and some change from his pockets.  As they left, they loosened the bonds that tied him.  10The police found chicken bones and five Pizza Pizza receipts in the stairwell at about 4:00 a.m. that morning. Three fingerprints belonging to the respondent were found on the receipt for the delivery to the building. A fourth print belonged to another man who was charged as a young offender.  The respondent turned himself in to the police on August 7, 2000 in response to an outstanding warrant for his arrest.  His father lived in the apartment building where the robbery occurred.  11Although the phone call ordering the food was traced to a cellular phone owned by a man not connected to the case, there had been a brief call a few minutes earlier to the same pizza store from a cellular phone which the police said could be circumstantially linked to the respondent.  That same cellular phone was used in connection with another robbery that took place on July 5, for which the respondent was later charged but tried separately.  The Challenge for Cause  12The respondent was initially arraigned on March 18, 2002 on two counts of robbery of pizza deliverymen: the July 5, 2000 robbery (where the victim was white) and the June 28, 2000 robbery (where the victim was East Indian).  The respondent did not deny that the robberies had occurred.  The only issue was whether he could properly be identified as the perpetrator.  13Before successfully applying for a severance of the two charges, the respondent sought to challenge potential jurors for cause, based on the fact that he is black and the victims were white and  East Indian respectively. The trial judge allowed a question based on the fact that the accused is black, but would not allow the additional enquiry addressing the race of the victim(s) or the resulting interracial nature of the crimes.  (At the time of the challenge, of course, the potential jurors would not know the race of the accused, the complainant or the witnesses unless they were told.)  14The trial judge mistakenly remembered theParksquestion as relating only to the colour of the accused, not the colour of the complainant.  However, he made it clear that in the exercise of his discretion he was limiting the challenge in this case to the race of the accused regardless of what the Ontario Court of Appeal had said inParks:  MR. GIOURGAS:  Your Honour, just for clarification sake.  Are you suggesting that I look atParksand if, in fact, it does say “white” then I can re-address the issue with Your Honour, or — ",

        "Facts": " 2.1Court of Québec  6On January 13, 2003, Mr. Angelillo pleaded guilty in the Court of Québec to a charge of theft over $5,000, contrary to s. 334(a)Cr. C.More than 37 times over a period of about a month and a half, Mr. Angelillo, who was employed as a security guard, failed to make deposits his employer had instructed him to make and instead took the money for his own use, thus misappropriating more than $425,000.  He used a large part of that amount to pay debts he had incurred to persons associated with organized crime, who were threatening him and his family.  The police also seized $150,000 during a search of his home.  7For reasons that are not apparent from the record, the sentencing hearing was not completed until April 21, 2004, more than 15 months after the guilty plea.  At that time, Judge Corte sentenced Mr. Angelillo to a term of imprisonment of two years less a day to be served in the community followed by two years’ probation, and ordered him to pay $268,430 as restitution under s. 738Cr. C.In imposing this sentence, the court accepted the submissions of the defence rather than those of Crown counsel, who had asked for an unconditional three‑year term of imprisonment.  8Judge Corte noted that the offender had no criminal record, had pleaded guilty at the start of the proceedings and had expressed remorse, and that the pre‑sentence report was favourable to him.  She also noted that Mr. Angelillo had three jobs at the time and was the sole source of support for his wife and for his three children, who were respectively 15 months, four years and seven years old.  Referring to the pre‑sentence report dated May 15, 2003, the judge added that the offender [translation] “has done some sincere soul‑searching about his inappropriate behaviour [and] has undertaken a rehabilitation process . . . and also counselling”, and that “his time in court has had a major deterrent effect on him”.  The report also stated that Mr. Angelillo was not dangerous and that his risk of re‑offending was low.  Judge Corte noted that there was a special circumstance in Mr. Angelillo’s case, namely that he had stolen because his life and the lives of his family were being threatened by creditors who had ties to organized crime.  There was physical evidence confirming that Mr. Angelillo had been threatened, and this fact was not disputed by the Crown.  Judge Corte therefore concluded that, in this instance, the penological objectives of deterrence and denunciation could be achieved by imposing a conditional sentence with certain conditions restricting Mr. Angelillo’s freedom.  2.2Fresh Evidence  9Following that decision, the Crown introduced motions in the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, for a stay of sentence and for leave to introduce fresh evidence.  Through the last of these motions, the Crown intended to file evidence showing:  (1) that, on August 20, 2003, Mr. Angelillo was arrested at an Insta‑Chèque counter while attempting to cash a forged certified cheque from the National Bank of Canada made payable to him in the amount of $12,000; and (2) that, on January 21, 2004, during a search of Mr. Angelillo’s home, police officers found a National Bank stamp with the words [translation] “certified cheque” on it and a starter kit containing a set of non‑personalized cheques, which came from a National Bank branch where Mr. Angelillo worked as a cleaner.  These allegations were the basis for the new charges against Mr. Angelillo.  10The Crown argues that this evidence was not available at trial and that it acted diligently to produce all the relevant evidence before Judge Corte.  In support of this argument, the Crown has submitted an affidavit from the prosecutor responsible for the case at trial.  The affidavit states that, in early June 2003, after the detective sergeant responsible for the case had committed an indiscretion by telling Mr. Angelillo the sentence the Crown intended to seek, Crown counsel told the detective sergeant that her presence at the sentencing hearing would no longer be required and that from then on counsel would be in contact only with the detective sergeant’s supervisor.  Before the hearing, counsel checked theplumitif, in which there was nothing about Mr. Angelillo, but did not contact either the detective sergeant or her supervisor.  On April 21, 2004, shortly after Judge Corte handed down her sentence, the detective sergeant ran into counsel at the courthouse by chance and told her the facts that the Crown is now seeking to introduce as fresh evidence.  According to the affidavit of the police officer responsible for the new investigation, the detective sergeant had been aware of this investigation since January 19, 2004.  2.3Court of Appeal  11The Quebec Court of Appeal (Beauregard, Mailhot and Doyon JJ.A.) dismissed the three motions filed by the Crown because, in the court’s view, the evidence was not relevant.  The court began by stating that, because of the presumption of innocence, the fact that Mr. Angelillo had been charged proved nothing.  It added that, in the present case, what the Crown wished to prove was not that he had been charged with another crime, but that the charge was substantiated.  The court rejected the Crown’s submission that the fresh evidence was admissible as character evidence under the principles stated by Rosenberg J.A. inEdwards.  In the court’s view, it is contrary to the presumption of innocence to consider, in sentencing an accused, facts that could constitute the basis for a separate criminal charge that has not resulted in conviction (para. 11).  The court concluded that taking into account evidence of facts tending to establish that an accused has committed another offence of which he or she has not been convicted amounts to punishing the accused more severely for having committed an act in respect of which he or she might ultimately be found not guilty (para. 14).

        "Facts": " 3On July 6, 1995, the appellant, Stephen Trochym, was convicted of second degree murder by a judge sitting with a jury. The deceased, Donna Hunter, was the appellant’s girlfriend of almost one year.  4Ms. Hunter was last seen alive late on Tuesday, October 13, 1992, or in the early hours of Wednesday, October 14. The Crown’s theory at trial was that the appellant had killed Ms. Hunter in a fit of rage after she had attempted to end their troubled relationship. Several of Ms. Hunter’s friends testified that the appellant was a jealous and obsessive partner who could not tolerate the thought of her leaving him. However, the appellant, who testified in his own defence, claimed that it was he who had ended the relationship that night and that when he left Ms. Hunter’s apartment at 12:30 a.m., she was still alive.  5Late on Tuesday, October 13, or in the early morning hours of Wednesday, October 14, Gity Haghnegahdar, a neighbour of Ms. Hunter’s, heard a man banging on the door of the deceased’s apartment, demanding to be let in. Although she did not see the man, Ms. Haghnegahdar heard the door eventually open to admit him. Given the estimated time of death, it was likely that the man who entered the apartment at that time was Ms. Hunter’s killer.  Establishing that it was the appellant knocking at the door was a key aspect of the Crown’s case. To this end, the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence that following Mr. Trochym’s breakup with a previous girlfriend (Darlene Oliphant) two years earlier, he had returned to her apartment and banged on the door, demanding to be let in.  6The neighbour, Ms. Haghnegahdar, also testified at trial that she had seen the appellant leaving Ms. Hunter’s apartment around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon. This testimony was considered critical by the Crown and was characterized as significant by the trial judge.  The Crown sought to use it to establish that Mr. Trochym had returned to Ms. Hunter’s apartment in the afternoon after the murder to “stage the scene” of the crime. By removing some personal effects and moving the body to make it appear as though the murder had been sexually motivated, the Crown argued, the appellant sought to distract attention from himself. The Crown’s theory was supported by forensic evidence that established that the deceased had been killed in the early hours of Wednesday morning, but that her body had been repositioned some eight to twelve hours after the murder.  7A key fact on appeal, however, was Ms. Haghnegahdar’s statement, when first interviewed by the police, that she had seen the appellant onThursdayafternoon, not Wednesday. It was only after undergoing hypnosis at the request of police investigators that Ms. Haghnegahdar stated that she had seen the accused on Wednesday afternoon.  8The appellant denied having returned to Ms. Hunter’s apartment, but admitted that he had returned to the apartment building to retrieve his car from the parking garage on Wednesday. To support his claim, Mr. Trochym adduced evidence that he was at work at the time the witness claimed to have seen him leaving the deceased’s apartment on Wednesday afternoon. The Crown argued that the appellant’s evidence on this point was concocted and further argued that the appellant’s demeanour in the days subsequent to the discovery of the deceased’s body was evidence of consciousness of guilt. When asked to attend a second meeting with the police, the appellant had made excuses not to attend, claiming that he was otherwise occupied with a darts game and a haircut appointment. Mr. Trochym testified at trial that he had been attempting to “stall” until he could consult with counsel, but the Crown suggested to the jury that the appellant’s post-offence conduct established that the appellant had lied when he claimed he wanted to help officers with their investigation, and that this was evidence of consciousness of guilt, because the appellant was evading police. Although this evidence was admitted, the trial judge instructed the jury that it “would be completely wrong to draw any adverse inference against the [appellant] from his desire to stall for time because he wanted to consult with a lawyer” (A.R., at p. 3736).  9Following a 14-week trial, Mr. Trochym was convicted of second degree murder on July 6, 1995. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed on July 5, 2004 ((2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 611). He applied for and was granted leave to appeal to this Court. ",

        "Facts": " 4Shortly after midnight on September 7, 2003, the complainant was awakened when a naked stranger was getting in her bed.  The intruder, Harjit Singh Shoker, followed her when she fled to the kitchen to phone the police but he did not attempt to leave.  On arrest, he told the police that he had been using a narcotic the previous day.  Mr. Shoker did not testify at trial.  He was convicted of breaking and entering a dwelling-house with intent to commit sexual assault.  5A psychological assessment report prepared by Dr. Whittemore for sentencing revealed that Mr. Shoker blamed his drug use for his behaviour, stating that he had been on speed at the time of the offence.  The report described a history of substance abuse, starting with alcohol as a teenager and later drugs including heroin, speed, cocaine and marijuana.  The report also referred to a similar incident that had occurred a few months earlier in respect of which Mr. Shoker had been charged and awaiting trial at the time of this offence.  Mr. Shoker told Dr. Whittemore that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of this previous incident and thought he was at a friend’s apartment.  He was acquitted on that charge.  Mr. Shoker did not feel that he needed treatment as he had not used drugs for the three months he had been in custody since his arrest.  Describing Mr. Shoker’s behaviour as disturbing, Dr. Whittemore suggested that the court might consider imposing a condition requiring him to submit to random urinalysis to assist in managing his risk in the community.  6The trial judge sentenced Mr. Shoker to 20 months’ incarceration to be followed by a two-year period of probation subject to a number of conditions.  The Crown did not ask that the order of probation include any condition for treatment or testing of bodily substances and the offender did not consent to those conditions.  The following two conditions were later challenged by Mr. Shoker on his appeal before the British Columbia Court of Appeal:  CONDITION 7:  You shall attend for such treatment and counselling as directed by the Probation Officer and successfully complete any such programs to which you are referred.  . . .  CONDITION 9:  Abstain absolutely from the consumption and possession of alcohol and non prescription narcotics and to submit to a urinalysis, blood test or breathalyzer test upon the demand/request of a Peace Officer or Probation Officer to determine compliance with this condition.  Any positive reading will be a breach of this condition.    7The Court of Appeal deleted the reference to “treatment” in Condition 7 because a treatment condition can only be imposed unders. 732.1(3)(g) of theCriminal Codewith the consent of the offender.  In addition, as the majority of the court noted, there is no program in British Columbia for curative treatment in relation to the consumption of alcohol or drugs as described in para. (g.1).  Condition 7 was amended accordingly and it is no longer in issue before this Court.  The court also deleted the last sentence of Condition 9 for lack of jurisdiction —  the sentencing judge could not predetermine that any positive reading would constitute a breach of probation as he had purported to do.  The question of any breach would have to form the basis of a new charge against Mr. Shoker and be determined by a court in the usual way.  8Fresh evidence admitted before the Court of Appeal revealed that funding for urinalysis testing had been discontinued as of March 31, 2003, and the service was no longer available in British Columbia.  Hence the question of urinalysis testing for this offender was effectively moot.  However, the court considered whether at law an offender can be required under the terms of a probation order to submit to a demand for a sample of bodily substances, including breath, urine and blood.  Levine J.A., Finch C.J.B.C. concurring, was of the view that the authority for imposing such a condition could be found ins. 732.1(3)(c) of theCriminal Codewith s. 732.1(3)(h) supporting this interpretation.  Despite this finding, Levine J.A., in writing for the majority, held that the requirement to provide bodily samples, in the absence of a regulatory or statutory framework governing how the samples will be taken and tested, violatess. 8of theCharterand that the defect cannot be cured by judicial fiat.  Hence, that part of Condition 9 following the words “non prescription narcotics” was deleted.  I read the majority’s reasons as effectively holding that there is no statutory authority to require a probationer to provide bodily samples on demand.  9Hall J.A., in partial dissent, was of the view that the authority to impose the condition could not be found under s. 732.1(3)(h) because “Parliament has spoken in a specific manner about alcohol and drugs in s. 732.1(3)(c)” (para. 70).  In his view, the power flowed rather from s. 732.1(3)(c) itself as “a reasonable methodology to ensure that such an order is effective” (para. 70).  Hall J.A. departed from the majority on the question  whether the condition could be amended to conform with theCharter.  He would have deleted the requirement to provide blood samples and would have amended Condition 9 to require that urine or breath samples be provided upon demand based on reasonable and probable grounds to suspect a violation of the abstention condition.

        "Facts": " 91The Court held that, generally, a witness’s testimony before a preliminary inquiry will satisfy the test for threshold reliability, since the fact that it was given under oath and subject to contemporaneous cross-examination in a hearing involving the same parties and mainly the same issues will provide sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness (para. 76).  In addition, the accuracy of the statement is certified by a written transcript which is signed by the judge, and the party against whom the hearsay evidence is tendered has the power to call the declarant as a witness.  The inability of the trier of fact to observe demeanour was found to be “more than compensated by the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness inherent in the adversarial, adjudicative process of a preliminary inquiry” (para. 77).  The fact that the early common law was prepared to admit former testimony under certain circumstances indicated an implicit acceptance of its reliability notwithstanding the lack of the declarant’s presence (para. 78).  Therefore, Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. concluded (at para. 79):  For these reasons, we find that a witness’s recorded testimony before a preliminary inquiry bears sufficient hallmarks of trustworthiness to permit the trier of fact to make substantive use of such statements at trial.  The surrounding circumstances of such testimony, particularly the presence of an oath or affirmation and the opportunity for contemporaneous cross‑examination, more than adequately compensate for the trier of fact’s inability to observe the demeanour of the witness in court.  The absence of the witness at trial goes to the weight of such testimony, not to its admissibility.  Applying this reasoning to the statement at issue, it was found to be reliable (para. 80).  92Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. added that the trial judge had erred in considering the internal contradictions contained in the testimony because these considerations properly related to the ultimate assessment of the actual probative value of the testimony, a matter for the trier of fact.  Although some of the analysis on this last point is couched in terms of categorizing factors as relevant to either threshold or ultimate reliability, an approach which should no longer be adopted, the Court’s conclusion on this point exemplifies where the line should be drawn on an inquiry into threshold reliability.  When the reliability requirement is met on the basis that the trier of fact has a sufficient basis to assess the statement’s truth and accuracy, there is no need to inquire further into the likely truth of the statement.  That question becomes one that is entirely left to the ultimate trier of fact and the trial judge is exceeding his or her role by inquiring into the likely truth of the statement.  When reliability is dependent on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement, the trial judge must inquire into those factors tending to show that the statement is true or not — recallU. (F.J.).  6.3Revisiting Paragraphes 215 and 217 in Starr  93As I trust it has become apparent from the preceding discussion, whether certain factors will go only to ultimate reliability will depend on the context.  Hence, some of the comments at paras. 215 and 217 inStarrshould no longer be followed.  Relevant factors should not be categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate reliability.  Rather, the court should adopt a more functional approach as discussed above and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers.  In addition, the trial judge must remain mindful of the limited role that he or she plays in determining admissibility — it is crucial to the integrity of the fact-finding process that the question of ultimate reliability not be pre-determined on the admissibilityvoir dire.  94I want to say a few words on one factor identified inStarr, namely“the presence of corroborating or conflicting evidence” since it is that comment that appears to have raised the most controversy.  I repeat it here for convenience:  Similarly, I would not consider the presence of corroborating or conflicting evidence.  On this point, I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision inR. v. C. (B.)(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 608; see alsoIdaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990). [para. 217]  95I will briefly review the two cases relied upon in support of this statement. The first does not really provide assistance on this question and the second, in my respectful view, should not be followed.  96InR. v. C. (B.)(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 608 (C.A.), the trial judge, in convicting the accused, had used a co‑accused’s statement as evidence in support of the complainant’s testimony.  The Court of Appeal held that this constituted an error.  While a statement made by a co-accused was admissible for its truth against the co‑accused, it remained hearsay as against the accused.  The co-accused had recanted his statement at trial.  His statement was not shown to be reliable so as to be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule against the accused.  Therefore, this case is of no assistance on the question of whether supporting evidence should be considered or not in determining hearsay admissibility.  It simply reaffirms the well-established rule that an accused’s statement is only admissible against its maker, not the co-accused.  97Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990), is more on point.  In that case, five of the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court were not persuaded that “evidence corroborating the truth of a hearsay statement may properly support a finding that the statement bears ‘particularized guarantees of trustworthiness’” (p. 822).  In the majority’s view, the use of corroborating evidence for that purpose “would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result we think at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility” (p. 823).  By way of example, the majority observed that a statement made under duress may happen to be true, but evidence tending to corroborate the truth of the statement would be no substitute for cross-examination of the declarant at trial.  The majority also raised the concern, arising mostly in child sexual abuse cases, that a jury may rely on the partial corroboration provided by medical evidence to mistakenly infer the trustworthiness of the entire allegation.  98In his dissenting opinion, Kennedy J., with whom the remaining three justices concurred, strongly disagreed with the position of the majority on the potential use of supporting or conflicting evidence. In my view, his reasons echo much of the criticism that has been voiced about this Court’s position inStarr.  He said the following:  I see no constitutional justification for this decision to prescind corroborating evidence from consideration of the question whether a child’s statements are reliable.  It is a matter of common sense for most people that one of the best ways to determine whether what someone says is trustworthy is to see if it is corroborated by other evidence.  In the context of child abuse, for example, if part of the child’s hearsay statement is that the assailant tied her wrists or had a scar on his lower abdomen, and there is physical evidence or testimony to corroborate the child’s statement, evidence which the child could not have fabricated, we are more likely to believe that what the child says is true.  Conversely, one can imagine a situation in which a child makes a statement which is spontaneous or is otherwise made under circumstances indicating that it is reliable, but which also contains undisputed factual inaccuracies so great that the credibility of the child’s statements is substantially undermined. Under the Court’s analysis, the statement would satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause despite substantial doubt about its reliability. [pp. 828-29]  99Kennedy J. also strongly disagreed with the majority’s view that only circumstances surrounding the making of the statement should be considered:  The [majority] does not offer any justification for barring the consideration of corroborating evidence, other than the suggestion that corroborating evidence does not bolster the “inherent trustworthiness” of the statements. But for purposes of determining the reliability of the statements, I can discern no difference between the factors that the Court believes indicate “inherent trustworthiness” and those, like corroborating evidence, that apparently do not.  Even the factors endorsed by the Court will involve consideration of the very evidence the Court purports to exclude from the reliability analysis.  The Court notes that one test of reliability is whether the child “use[d] . . . terminology unexpected of a child of similar age.”  But making this determination requires consideration of the child’s vocabulary skills and past opportunity, or lack thereof, to learn the terminology at issue.  And, when all of the extrinsic circumstances of a case are considered, it may be shown that use of a particular word or vocabulary in fact supports the inference of prolonged contact with the defendant, who was known to use the vocabulary in question.  As a further example, the Court notes that motive to fabricate is an index of reliability.  But if the suspect charges that a third person concocted a false case against him and coached the child, surely it is relevant to show that the third person had no contact with the child or no opportunity to suggest false testimony.  Given the contradictions inherent in the Court’s test when measured against its own examples, I expect its holding will soon prove to be as unworkable as it is illogical.  The short of the matter is that both the circumstances existing at the time the child makes the statements and the existence of corroborating evidence indicate, to a greater or lesser degree, whether the statements are reliable. If the Court means to suggest that the circumstances surrounding the making of a statement are the best indicators of reliability, I doubt this is so in every instance.  And, if it were true in a particular case, that does not warrant ignoring other indicators of reliability such as corroborating evidence, absent some other reason for excluding it.  If anything, I should think that corroborating evidence in the form of testimony or physical evidence, apart from the narrow circumstances in which the statement was made, would be a preferred means of determining a statement’s reliability for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, for the simple reason that, unlike other indicators of trustworthiness, corroborating evidence can be addressed by the defendant and assessed by the trial court in an objective and critical way.  [References omitted; pp. 833-34.]  100In my view, the opinion of Kennedy J. better reflects the Canadian experience on this question.  It has proven difficult and at times counterintuitive to limit the inquiry to the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement.  This Court itself has not always followed this restrictive approach.  Further, I do not find the majority’s concern over the “bootstrapping” nature of corroborating evidence convincing.  On this point, I agree with Professor Paciocco who commented on the reasoning of the majority inIdaho v. Wrightas follows (at p. 36):  The final rationale offered is that it would involve “bootstrapping” to admit evidence simply because it is shown by other evidence to be reliable.  In fact, the “bootstrapping” label is usually reserved to circular arguments in which a questionable piece of evidence “picks itself up by its own bootstraps” to fit within an exception.  For example, a party claims it can rely on a hearsay statement because the statement was made under such pressure or involvement that the prospect of concoction can fairly be disregarded, but then relies on the contents of the hearsay statement to prove the existence of that pressure or involvement [Ratten v. R., [1972] A.C. 378 (P.C.)].  Or, a party claims it can rely on the truth of the contents of a statement because it was a statement made by an opposing party litigant, but then relies on the contents of the statement to prove it was made by an opposing party litigant:  seeR. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869.  Looking tootherevidence to confirm the reliability of evidence, the thingIdaho v. Wrightpurports to prevent, is the very antithesis of “bootstrapping”. ",

        "Facts": " The trial judge’s different treatment of Farmer would be understandable if Clayton and Farmer had been two unconnected pedestrians who happened to be leaving the Million Dollar Saloon parking lot at the same time, but independently.  However that is not this case.  Farmer, being black, fit the general description by the 911 caller.  He was leaving the parking lot in the same car as Clayton soon after the 911 gun call.  Once the trial judge concluded that sufficient grounds existed to require Clayton to get out of the car and submit to a search for reasons of police safety incidental to detention it follows, I think that it would have been foolhardy for the police, in the context of a gun call, to leave Farmer, possibly armed, in the car while they went about their business with Clayton.  Nor could the police be expected to allow Farmer to drive away.  If Farmer, left alone in the driver’s seat, had taken a shot at the police, there would have been legitimate questions raised about police training and police judgment and the unreality of a law that led to such an avoidable result.  The respondents were travelling together and the concerns about officer safety raised by the glove-wearing, possibly gun-flourishing Clayton gave rise to a sufficient concern about the driver to warrant a pat-down search of Farmer for officer safety incidental (at that point) to Farmer’s continued detention.  Nevertheless, this point is complicated in Farmer’s case because, before he was searched, he was arrested.  125Farmer was out of the car and was putting his hands on the roof when Clayton tried to bolt (trial judgment, at paras. 23-24).  The arresting officer initially testified that he did not arrest Farmer until after he received word that Clayton had a gun.  However, the police tapes showed thisnotto be the case.  The arresting officer had no such information.  Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that “[a] reasonable person placed in [Constable] Mulholland’s position could not conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest” (para. 82).  The search of Farmer took placeafterhis arrest.  The trial judge therefore found:  The search was conducted in a reasonable manner and incident to an arrest.  However, the arrest was unlawful and the search violated Mr. Farmer’s s. 8 rights. [para. 83]  The trial judge thus treated the intervening arrest as determinative of Farmer’s rights.  It seems to me overly formalistic however to hold that, while the police were entitled to conduct a pat-down search of Farmer incidental to his continued detention, the entitlement vanished with the wrongful pronouncement of the words of arrest, even though the officer safety issue remained the same.  To put it another way, I do not think the effect of the arrest can be said to haveenlargedFarmer’s reasonable expectation of privacy.  An arrest, of course, gives the police greater powers of search than aManndetention, but the fact is that what happened to Farmer was a pat-down search well within the bounds of aManndetention.  126I would therefore hold that the pat-down search of Farmer that resulted in the seizure of the gun was not rendered unconstitutional by the words of arrest that intervened between getting Farmer out of the car and the police pat-down search to ensure officer safety.  Had I concluded otherwise, I would, nevertheless, have agreed with the trial judge that the gun should be admitted under s. 24(2).  L.In Any Event, Section 24(2) Was Properly Invoked in Farmer’s Case  127In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. stated that:  The trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis proceeded on the basis that the initial stop was constitutional.  I have concluded that it was unconstitutional.  It follows that the usual deference owed to a trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis has no application . . . . [para. 69]  As, on the contrary, I accept the trial judge’s conclusion that the initial stop was constitutional, I would have been prepared to defer to the trial judge’s s. 24(2) decision to admit the gun as evidence against Farmer. 128All parties agree that s. 24(2) requires the application of the well-known three-part test articulated inR. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  The court looks first at the effect of the admission of the impugned evidence on the fairness of the trial, second at the seriousness of theCharterviolation and third at the negative impact, if any, on the administration of justice that would be occasioned by the admission of the evidence.  Both the trial judge and Doherty J.A. agreed, as do I, that admission of the gun would not affect trial fairness.  Doherty J.A.’s view of the seriousness of theCharterbreach was predicated on his conclusion that the original blockade detention was unconstitutional.  He states:  Farmer and Clayton were entitled to proceed on their way.  Instead, they found themselves in a potentially demeaning and frightening confrontation with the police.  The roadblock stop led to a serious violation of theirCharterrights.   The significance of theCharterbreaches is not minimized because it turns out that Farmer and Clayton were in possession of loaded prohibited weapons. . . . Criminals do not have different constitutional rights than the rest of the community. [paras. 77-78]  On the s. 24(2) point, I accept the conclusion of the trial judge who held that, while theCharterviolations were not “technical or trivial, they were not serious enough as to support exclusion” (para. 99).  In support of his conclusion the trial judge observed that  the violations occurred in a fast-paced situation, where the officer had little time for reflection. . . .  . . . the fact it was a gun call is an important consideration.   Constable Mulholland saw the Robson-Clayton struggle and Clayton’s flight. . . . As regards the search incident to arrest, the officer honestly but mistakenly believed he had the information that would give him reasonable and probable grounds.  Again, there is no bad faith. [paras. 95 and 97-98]  129As stated, Doherty J.A. made an important point about the potential contribution of inadequate training to excessive police conduct.  ACharterviolation caused by systemic failure would raise greater concerns for the administration of justice than an isolated act of a single misguided police officer.  However, given my conclusion that the roadblock (i.e., detention) was valid, I do not think the adequacy of police training emerges as a s. 24(2) consideration in this case.  130As to whether admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, I agree with the trial judge that “[t]he evidence sought to be excluded is essential to the prosecution of serious charges.  The officer had legitimate concerns for his safety.  Given the fast-paced events over a brief period of time as noted above, the officers had to make quick decisions without time for reflection.  I consider as well the nature of the search contemplated” (para. 100).  The trial judge therefore held:  To exclude the evidence of a loaded gun in these circumstances, would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would occur if it was admitted. [para. 101]  131I agree.  If it had been necessary to resort to s. 24(2), my view is that the gun found on Farmer was properly admitted in evidence.

        "Facts": " [111]The following facts are found in the Statement of Facts for Guilty Plea (Appellant’s Record, Exhibit 1, at pp. 164-66).  [112]On December 13, 2003, D.B., who was 17 at the time, went to a shopping mall in Hamilton with some friends.  They began exchanging insults with another group of young men and two of them decided to fight.  When the fight between those two began outside the mall, D.B. turned to Jonathan Romero and said “Me and you are going to fight right now”.  Romero said “No”.  Romero was watching the others fight with his arms down at his sides when D.B. punched him on the right side of his neck and face area.   The punch was described as a “sucker punch” meaning that Romero was neither prepared nor ready for the punch.  Romero fell to the ground from the force of D.B.’s punch.  D.B. then continued the assault by jumping on top of Romero and punching him four more times on the face and neck.  Romero was knocked unconscious and unable to defend himself.  [113]D.B. then fled back towards the shopping mall.  The two other combatants stopped fighting and, along with three employees of a nearby store, came to the aid of the victim.  An ambulance was called.  When it arrived, Romero had no vital signs.  Romero later died of his injuries.  [114]Inside the shopping mall, D.B. was heard to say:  “You missed it, it was one punch, the guy’s not even fuckin’ moving.”  D.B. changed his clothes in a nearby restaurant, stowed the old clothes in a knapsack and gave the knapsack to another person.  He then went to the home of one of his friends, talking about the fight on the way.  Later that evening, D.B. went to a nightclub.  He left with some friends in a taxi around closing time.  [115]In the taxi, D.B. learned via cellular telephone that Romero had died.  He stayed the night at the home of one of his friends.  When the police arrived at the friend’s home the following morning, D.B. attempted to flee out the back door, but was subsequently caught and arrested.  [116]D.B. pleaded guilty and was convicted of manslaughter.  He made an application to receive a youth sentence, which was opposed by the Crown.  [117]D.B. had had frequent physical altercations with peers and had been suspended from high school numerous times, primarily for disruptive behaviour, verbal aggression, and disrespectful and intimidating conduct towards school staff.  At the time of the offence, D.B. was bound by two separate probation orders, arising out of prior convictions for possession of stolen property and robbery.  Both offences involved threats and intimidation.  While he was in custody awaiting disposition and sentence for manslaughter, D.B. was involved in several assaultive incidents with other inmates and staff members (see Predisposition Assessment, Appellant’s Record, at pp. 184-85).  [118]As a result of the Crown opposing his youth sentence application, D.B. challenged the constitutionality of the presumptive offence provisions of theYCJA.  The sentencing judge allowed theCharterchallenge ((2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 605 (S.C.J.)).  He imposed a youth sentence of 30 months in a juvenile correctional facility.  The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal, holding that the presumptive offence provisions violateds. 7of theCharterand were not saved under s. 1 ((2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 698). ",

        "Facts": "[64]It might be argued that evidence that was accepted in the first case — that the accused did not know he lacked sufficient funds to cover the cheque — and led to an acquittal, was rejected in a second case, leading to a conviction.  However, confining issue estoppel to its proper domain of preventing relitigation of issues resolved in favour of the accused in an earlier proceeding, yields a different result.  In the first trial, the factual issue of state of mind was resolved in the accused’s favour on the basis of his evidence that he thought he had sufficient funds.  On the second trial, the evidence was called not to show that the earlier determination was in error, but to show that on the second occasion the accused could not have believed he had sufficient funds to cover the cheque, as he could not have made the same mistake twice.  This rationale does not involve challenging the judicial determination in the first trial or in any way rejecting the findings at the first trial as to the accused’s state of mind.  The original acquittal, and the reasons for it, stand unimpeached.  Yet, the facts on which it was based may have relevance in the second trial and can be admitted on that basis, without calling the first finding into question.  As Cory J. noted inArp, a careful jury instruction is required in these circumstances (para. 78).  [65]If the Crown is not trying to contradict the factual finding at the first trial, issue estoppel does not apply.  The relevant question is whether the Crown is leading evidence which is inconsistent with the factual findings in the first trial (even if those findings were arrived at on the basis of reasonable doubt).  A jury charge to this effect, coupled with a caution not to use the evidence underlying the prior acquittal to support reasoning that the accused in fact committed the offence for which he was previously acquitted, suffice to preserve the protections offered by the principle of issue estoppel, without rendering the trial unworkable.  [66]Another apparent difficulty is the so-calledArpanomaly.  Issue estoppel holds that where an issue is decided in favour of the accused in a first trial that leads to an acquittal, evidence on that issue cannot be used as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial.  Yet, the similar fact rule permits evidence of similar facts to be called in a multi-count trial.  This produces the following anomaly.  If the issue on which the Crown seeks to lead similar fact evidence was determined in a previous trial ending in acquittal, it is inadmissible on a second trial.  However, if the same fact is relevant to two offences being tried together, it may be admissible.  What determines admissibility is not the nature of the evidence, but whether it has been the subject of a previous trial that led to an acquittal.  At first glance, this does not seem right, since the evidence’s admissibility turns on what will sometimes be arbitrary factors leading to consecutive rather than multi-count trials.  [67]InArp, this Court,perCory J., held that the principle of issue estoppel, as applied to previous acquittals, “has no application where the alleged similar acts are the subject of a multi-count indictment” (para. 79).  However, uncertainty remains.  Does this mean that the Crown can lead evidence regarding acts which have been the subject of acquittals as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial? (See L. Stuesser, “Admitting Acquittals as Similar Fact Evidence” (2002), 45Crim. L.Q.488.)  Or is the ruling in error, as others have suggested? (See R. Mahoney, “Acquittals as Similar Fact Evidence: Another View” (2003), 47Crim. L.Q.265; see also K. E. Wright, “Similar Fact Multiple Count Indictments — A Reply” (1994), 32 C.R. (4th) 301 (written beforeArp).)  [68]It could be argued thatArpis in tension with the issue estoppel, as defined by Lamer J. inGrdic, because in a joint trial on multiple counts, the effect ofArpmay be that the accused does not get the benefit of factual issues on which the jury has a reasonable doubt on one count.  Nevertheless, the approach inArpcan be justified for three reasons.  [69]First, in theArpsituation, the finality concern of issue estoppel does not arise because the two (or more) matters are being tried together.  There is nopriorfinding of fact.  [70]Second, the joint trial of multiple counts raises the problem of how to charge the jury if the law were to require that the evidence of one count be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before it could be used as similar fact evidence on another count.  The general rule fromR. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, that individual pieces of evidence need not be proved on the reasonable doubt standard militates against holding (and charging a jury) that the evidence of one count cannot be used as similar fact evidence on another count unless the first count is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Given the rationales for issue estoppel, the difference in result depending on the order in which charges are tried or whether they are tried together, is defensible in this context.  The Court inArpaccepted this argument (at paras. 64-79) as the basis for distinguishing the multi-count indictment situation from the acquittal at a prior trial situation.  [71]Third, it has been suggested that the so-calledArpanomaly can be resolved with a jury instruction (see Stewart, at p. 396).  To satisfy the principle of issue estoppel where one trial follows another, what must be avoided at the second proceeding is reliance on issues that have earlier been resolved in the accused’s favour.  It follows that in a trial with multiple counts of similar allegations, what must be avoided is a situation where the trier of fact rejects the evidence led on one count, yet uses it to find guilt on a different count.  This can be cured by an instruction to the jury.  [72]SinceR. v. Handy, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56, an essential step in the admissibility and use of similar fact evidence is the identification of the specific factual issue on which the evidence is probative of the improbability of coincidence.  This may be the identity of the offender, the unlikelihood that independent witnesses would tell similar stories, or any other relevant and probative inference.  In a multi-count indictment, the trier of fact should instruct himself, or in the case of a jury be instructed, that if the trier of fact rejects the evidence on such an issue in a particular count, then it cannot use that evidence in deciding the verdict in any other of the counts (see Stewart, at p. 396).  Indeed, Cory J. suggests a similar instruction in point (6) of the model jury charge inArp(para. 80).  [73]In summary, if issue estoppel is understood according to its defining features, as discussed earlier, the inconsistency between the rule and other principles of evidence and common sense largely disappears.  E.Conclusion on the Retention of Issue Estoppel on the Criminal Law  [74]There can be no doubt that the principle of issue estoppel, as applied in Canada sinceGrdic, has led to inconsistencies with other principles of criminal law and common sense.  The question on this appeal, as I see it, is whether these inconsistencies should lead this Court to remove issue estoppel entirely from Canadian criminal law, or whether it should modify the current Canadian position on issue estoppel to alleviate the difficulties.  [75]I have argued that an approach to issue estoppel that confines it to discrete issues decided in the accused’s favour in a previous proceeding is consistent with the history and theory of issue estoppel and, if adopted, would avoid the anomalies the broadened post-Grdicview of the doctrine has introduced.  I have also argued that, understood in this form, issue estoppel is an important component of the criminal law, and that other doctrines and rules of evidence afford only incomplete protection of the goals that underlie the doctrine: fairness to the accused, coherence and consistency of criminal proceedings and finality of judicial proceedings.  [76]These arguments satisfy me that the principle of issue estoppel should be retained as part of Canadian criminal law.  [77]It is not necessary in this case to resolve the question of whether issue estoppel applies to situations where there is a disposition such as a stay at a first trial: see, for example,R. v. Regan(1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 286 (N.S.S.C.);Rulli.  On the one hand, cases of stays often involve determinations not based on the merits, and thus may not give rise to any factual findings (or, as Professor Stewart points in relation to entrapment, factual findings contrary to the accused may have been made, since entrapment is not even considered until after a finding of guilt has been made (pp. 389-90)).  On the other hand, in many cases where a stay was issued for reasons such as  abuse of process or unreasonable delay, the factors which led to the stay may still be compelling when an attempt is made by the Crown to use the evidence at a later proceeding.  It may well be that a more flexible approach such as abuse of process should be used for these cases, rather than issue estoppel.  However, as this case does not engage a fact situation involving a stay of proceedings, I leave that issue for a future case.

            "8                                   I pause here to say that the trial judge, in asking Mr. Teskey if he had anything to say, appears to be mistakenly referring to s. 726  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which requires a trial judge to ask an accused whether he has anything to say prior to the delivery of the sentence.  In my view, this momentary lapse, in and of itself, is of no consequence.  However, as I will explain, the trial judge’s expressed willingness to reconsider the verdict, immediately after it has been rendered, contributes to the overall appearance that the process of deliberation was still ongoing.",
            "17                               The same principles apply in a criminal case.  For example, it is often necessary in the interests of achieving trial efficiency for a trial judge to announce promptly the disposition on an evidentiary ruling or on a Charter motion, with reasons to follow at a later date.  In particular circumstances, there may also be good reason for  announcing the verdict in a criminal case prior to delivering the reasons that led to it.  For example, the prompt delivery of a verdict of acquittal may allow an accused to be immediately released from custody.  Or it may be desirable to announce a verdict of guilty at the conclusion of the hearing so as to secure an earlier date in the court’s schedule for the subsequent sentence proceedings.  However, in all cases, a trial judge should be mindful of the importance that justice not only be done but that it appear to be done.  The circumstances of this case exemplify the kind of issues that can arise when the announcement of the verdict is divorced from the delivery of the reasons that led to it.",
            "18                               Reasons rendered long after a verdict, particularly where it is apparent that they were entirely crafted after the announcement of the verdict, may cause a reasonable person to apprehend that the trial judge may not have reviewed and considered the evidence with an open mind as he or she is duty-bound to do but, rather, that the judge has engaged in result-driven reasoning.  In other words, having already announced the verdict, particularly a verdict of guilt, a question arises whether the post-decision review and analysis of the evidence was done, even subconsciously, with the view of defending the verdict rather than arriving at it.  It is most important in a criminal case to guard against any result-driven consideration of the evidence because the accused is presumed innocent and entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt.  A reasonable doubt is not always obvious. Its presence may be far more subtle and only discernible through the eyes of the person who keeps an open mind.  It is in this sense that the trial judge who appears to have already committed to a verdict of guilt before completing the necessary analysis of the evidence may cause a reasonable person to apprehend that he or she has not kept an open mind.  Further, if an appeal from the verdict has been launched, as here, and the reasons deal with certain issues raised on appeal, this may create the appearance that the trial judge is advocating a particular result rather than articulating the reasons that led him or her to the decision.",
            "... the purpose ... is to preserve and enhance meaningful appellate review of the correctness of the decision (which embraces both errors of law and palpable overriding errors of fact). If deficiencies in the reasons do not, in a particular case, foreclose meaningful appellate review, but allow for its full exercise, the deficiency will not justify intervention under s. 686  of the Criminal Code . That provision limits the power of the appellate court to intervene to situations where it is of the opinion that (i) the verdict is unreasonable, (ii) the judgment is vitiated by an error of law and it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, or (iii) on any ground where there has been a miscarriage of justice.

        "Facts": " A.Gibson  [35]Mr. Gibson was charged with operating a vehicle while having over 80 mg, contrary tos. 253(b) of theCriminal Code.  At trial in the Nova Scotia Provincial Court, the arresting officer testified that he saw Mr. Gibson driving his all-terrain vehicle on the highway, that he stopped him at 8:59 p.m. on July 13, 2003, that Mr. Gibson’s breath  smelled of alcohol, and that his speech was slurred. The officer administered two breathalyzer tests, which indicated that Mr. Gibson’s blood alcohol content was 120 mg at 10:12 p.m. and 100 mg at 10:21 p.m.  [36]Mr. Gibson testified that he had consumed ten beers over a period of seven hours on the day in question and had consumed five of them shortly before being stopped by the police.  His testimony was corroborated by another witness. An expert witness for the defence testified that, assuming that the pattern of consumption attested to by Mr. Gibson and the corroborating witness was accurate and based on the average alcohol elimination rates of men of Mr. Gibson’s age, height and weight, Mr. Gibson would have had a blood alcohol content of between 40 and 105 mg at 8:59 p.m., when he was stopped by the police.  [37]The trial judge accepted both the evidence of Mr. Gibson’s consumption and the expert evidence.  He held that the evidence that Mr. Gibson’s blood alcohol content would have been between 40 and 105 mg at the time he last operated the vehicle was evidence to the contrary that rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1).  The trial judge was left with a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gibson’s blood alcohol content had exceeded the legal limit, and acquitted him ((2004), 225 N.S.R. (2d) 16, 2004 NSPC 40).  [38]The Nova Scotia Supreme Court upheld the acquittal despite the Crown’s submission that expert evidence based on elimination rates in the general population could not constitute evidence to the contrary ((2004), 227 N.S.R. (2d) 165, 2004 NSSC 228).  The court held that, since it is practically impossible for an accused to accurately determine his or her elimination rate at the time of the alleged offence, to reject evidence of elimination rates in the general population would amount to making the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1) an irrebuttable one, which could lead to false convictions.  [39]The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial ((2006), 243 N.S.R. (2d) 325, 2006 NSCA 51).  It cited this Court’s decision inR. v. Boucher, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 499, 2005 SCC 72, for the proposition that an expert opinion based on average tendencies of the population is without foundation and thus inadmissible.  Therefore, the Court of Appeal held that the Nova Scotia Supreme Court had erred in finding that evidence of a hypothetical person’s elimination rates was capable of rebutting the presumption in s. 258(1)(d.1).  B.MacDonald [40]Like Mr. Gibson, Mr. MacDonald was charged with operating a vehicle while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 mg, contrary tos. 253(b) of theCriminal Code.  On February 26, 2003, he was stopped at a check stop, where a police officer noted that Mr. MacDonald smelled of alcohol, was talking in a deliberate manner and had some difficulty in walking. Two breath tests produced identical readings of 146 mg, which were rounded down to 140 mg for purposes of the charge.  [41]Mr. MacDonald testified that he had consumed six cans of beer over four and a half hours and had consumed the last can five minutes before being stopped by the police.  A friend corroborated this evidence.  [42]At trial, Mr. MacDonald adduced expert evidence that, according to a test conducted several months after he was charged, his elimination rate was 18.5 mg per hour and that, assuming he had eliminated alcohol at the same rate on the night of the alleged offence, his blood alcohol content would have been 71 mg_below the legal limit_at the relevant time.  In testing Mr. MacDonald’s elimination rate, the expert did not attempt to recreate the conditions on the night Mr. MacDonald was charged as regards the type and pattern of alcohol consumption and the amount of food consumed.  Instead, the expert had Mr. MacDonald drink a mix of Diet Seven‑Up and vodka over a period of five minutes until he reached a target range of between 50 and 60 mg.  The expert then plotted Mr. MacDonald’s blood alcohol readings on a chart. In addition to testifying that Mr. MacDonald’s blood alcohol content would have been 71 mg, the expert stated that a man of Mr. MacDonald’s age, height and weight who eliminated alcohol at an average rate would have had a blood alcohol content of 64 to 109 mg at the relevant time.  [43]The trial judge convicted Mr. MacDonald on the basis that the expert evidence did not tend to show that his blood alcohol content had not exceeded 80 mg (2003 CarswellAlta 1986). In his opinion, Mr. MacDonald’s alcohol elimination rate according to the expert’s test did not raise a reasonable doubt, because it did not reflect the type of alcohol or the amount of food consumed, and the expert had testified that these factors would influence a person’s elimination rate.  The trial judge also noted that, based on elimination rates in the general population, the midpoint of the range of blood alcohol levels was 86.5 mg, which is over the legal limit.  [44]The Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench upheld the conviction for the reason that the “straddle evidence”_that is, evidence of a range of possible blood alcohol levels lying both below and above the legal limit_was speculative and was not probative of Mr. MacDonald’s blood alcohol content at the time of the offence ((2004), 47 Alta. L.R. (4th) 242, 2004 ABQB 629).  The court added that to rebut the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c), (d.1) and (g), an accused must adduce evidence that would “eliminate a scenario whereby the accused’s blood‑alcohol level is over 80 [mg] at the time of driving” (para. 37).  [45]The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed, relying in part onBoucher.It stated thatevidence of blood alcohol content that disregards the personal characteristics of the accused at the time of the alleged offence constitutes an attack on the fictional nature of the presumption and is inadmissible.  It therefore also rejected the use of average elimination rates and of straddle evidence_at least to the extent that straddle evidence is based on elimination rates in the general population ((2006), 60 Alta. L.R. (4th) 205, 2006 ABCA 177). ",

Unquestionably, conduct which constitutes a departure from the norm expected of a reasonably prudent person forms the basis of both civil and penal negligence.  However, it is important not to conflate the civil standard of negligence with the test for penal negligence.  Unlike civil negligence, which is concerned with the apportionment of loss, penal negligence is aimed at punishing blameworthy conduct.  Fundamental principles of criminal justice require that the law on penal negligence concern itself not only with conduct that deviates from the norm, which establishes the actus reus of the offence, but with the offender’s mental state.  The  onus lies on the Crown to prove both the actus reus and the mens rea.  Moreover, where liability for penal negligence includes potential imprisonment, as is the case under s. 249  of the Criminal Code , the distinction between civil and penal negligence acquires a constitutional dimension.",
            "[7]                              The modified objective test established by this Court’s jurisprudence remains the appropriate test to determine the requisite mens rea for negligence-based criminal offences.  As the label suggests, this test for penal negligence “modifies” the purely objective norm for determining civil negligence.  It does so in two important respects.  First, there must be a “marked departure” from the civil norm in the circumstances of the case.  A mere departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent person will meet the threshold for civil negligence, but will not suffice to ground liability for penal negligence.  The distinction between a mere departure and a marked departure from the norm is a question of degree.  It is only when the conduct meets the higher threshold that the court may find, on the basis of that conduct alone, a blameworthy state of mind.",
            "[8]                              Second, unlike the test for civil negligence which does not concern itself with the mental state of the driver, the modified objective test for penal negligence cannot ignore the actual mental state of the accused.  Objective mens rea is based on the premise that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have been aware of the risks arising from the conduct.  The fault lies in the absence of the requisite mental state of care.  Hence, the accused cannot avoid a conviction by simply stating that he or she was not thinking about the manner of driving.  However, where the accused raises a reasonable doubt whether a reasonable person in his or her position would have been aware of the risks arising from the conduct, the premise for finding objective fault is no longer sound and there must be an acquittal.  The analysis is thus contextualized, and allowances are made for defences such as incapacity and mistake of fact.  This is necessary to ensure compliance with the fundamental principle of criminal justice that the innocent not be punished.",
            "[10]                          The tragic accident giving rise to the criminal charges against Mr. Beatty happened on July 23, 2003 at approximately 2:00 p.m. on Highway 1, about 14 km west of Chase, British Columbia.  The weather was clear, sunny and very hot; the asphalt surface of the road well travelled, in good repair, bare and dry.  The collision occurred when upon reaching a curve on the highway the pick-up truck driven by Mr. Beatty suddenly, and for no apparent reason, crossed the double solid centre line into the path of an oncoming vehicle, killing all three occupants.",
            "The circumstances in this case are different.  Here there is no evidence of any improper driving by Mr. Beatty before his truck veered into the westbound lane and into the oncoming vehicle.  While that act of driving was clearly negligent it occurred within a matter of seconds.  Moreover, there was no evidence of any evasive measures or evidence of any obstruction in the eastbound lane that might have caused him to veer into the westbound lane.  In my view, the only reasonable inference to be drawn in these circumstances, of Mr. Beatty’s manner of driving, was that he experienced a loss of awareness, whether that was caused by him nodding off or for some other reason.  That loss of awareness resulted in him continuing to drive straight instead of following the curve in the road and thereby cross the double solid line.  These few seconds of clearly negligent driving, which had devastating consequences, are the only evidence of Mr. Beatty’s manner of driving.  In my view, Hundal requires something more than a few seconds of lapsed attention to establish objectively dangerous driving.  Criminal culpability cannot be found, beyond a reasonable doubt, on such a paucity of evidence.  [para. 36]",
            "[14]                          The trial judge then expounded on the distinction between criminal and civil  negligence as follows:",
            "This tragic accident occurred from a momentary lapse of attention and snuffed out the lives of three individuals.  There is nothing a court can do or say that will adequately redress the loss suffered by the victims’ families in such circumstances.  However, in assessing criminal culpability it is not the consequences of a negligent act of driving that determines whether an accused’s manner of driving is objectively dangerous.  It is the driving itself that must be examined.  In my view, Mr. Beatty’s few seconds of negligent driving, in the absence of something more, is insufficient evidence to support a finding of a marked departure from the standard of care of a prudent driver. As contemplated by Hundal Mr. Beatty’s negligent driving undoubtedly falls within the continuum of negligence that is certain to attract considerable civil liability.  It is in that forum that redress for his actions will be found.  [Emphasis in original; para. 37.]",
            "[18]                          In the context of this proceeding, no one disputes that, in crossing the centre lane into the path of an oncoming motor vehicle, Mr. Beatty’s manner of driving fell below the standard of care of a reasonably prudent driver.  We recognize here the well‑established standard for the tort of negligence.  As noted by the trial judge, Mr. Beatty’s negligent driving would therefore undoubtedly attract civil liability.  I will refer to the standard for the tort of negligence simply as “civil negligence”.  The more difficult question is whether Mr. Beatty’s act of negligent driving also attracts criminal liability for the offence of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death under s. 249(4)  of the Criminal Code ."

        "Facts": " [23]Of course, Dickson J. was identifying here the presumptive common law principles that apply in the absence of a contrary legislative intention.  He made this context clear in his subsequent judgment (dissenting, but not on this point) inR. v. Pappajohn, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, where he aptly summed up the pre-Charterlegal landscape as follows:  There rests now, at the foundation of our system of criminal justice, the precept that a man cannot be adjudged guilty and subjected to punishment, unless the commission of the crime was voluntarily directed by a willing mind.  Blackstone spoke of a “vicious act” consequent upon a “vicious will” (Commentaries, Book IV, at p. 21).  Proof of the mental element is an essential and constituent step in establishing criminal responsibility. Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal offences for which a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient.  Equally,mens reais not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are concerned with public welfare, health and safety.  Subject to these exceptions,mens rea, consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil intention, or knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard of consequences, must be proved by the prosecution.  The mental element may be established by inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence. [pp. 138-39]  3.2Fundamental Principles of Criminal Justice Under theCharter  [24]With the advent of theCharter, the parameters of valid federal and provincial legislation became defined, not only along division of powers lines but by minimal constitutional requirements.  Therefore, with theChartercame a renewed interest in the mental elements of crimes and regulatory offences.  To what extent had the fundamental principles of criminal justice that gave rise to the common law presumptions onmens reabecome constitutionally entrenched?  The question came to the fore shortly after theChartercame into force inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  [25]The British ColumbiaMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, provided for minimum periods of imprisonment for the offence of driving on a highway or industrial road without a valid driver’s licence or with a licence under suspension.  Moreover, s. 94(2) of the Act provided that this offence was one of absolute liability in which guilt was established by the proof of driving, whether or not the driver knew of the prohibition or suspension.  On a reference brought by the provincial government, the British Columbia Court of Appeal found s. 94(2) inconsistent withs. 7of theCharterand of no force or effect.  The decision was upheld by this Court.  Lamer J. (as he then was) made it clear that in the post-Charterera, absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined.  This holds true regardless of whether imprisonment is mandatory or not.  Though absolute liability provisions are not in and of themselves unconstitutional, they will be offensive to principles of fundamental justice entrenched unders. 7of theCharterto the extent that they have the potential of depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person.  The fundamental principle at play was stated as follows (at p. 513):  It has from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the innocent not be punished.  This principle has long been recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law.  It is so old that its first enunciation was in Latinactus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.  [26]It therefore became clear thatmens rea, as a presumed element inSault Ste. Marie, had acquired a constitutional dimension.  As noted subsequently inR. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636 (where the Court held that subjectivemens reawas constitutionally required in respect of the offence of murder): ",

        "Facts": " [5]On April 23, 2004, the appellant and Teanda Manchur went out for the evening.  One of their children was visiting at a nearby lake while the other was spending a night with the appellant’s sister.  They went to the home of Tyler Sanjenko and his partner Amanda Weger, friends of the appellant, around 9:30 p.m.  Present were Amanda’s sister, Larry Hubick and his wife Chantel Huel.  The group socialized and drank until about 10:15 p.m., when they went bowling.  They bowled and drank at the bowling alley until about midnight. Most of the group then went to the Crown and Hand bar in the neighbourhood.  They drank until the bar closed at 3:30 a.m.  The group then went back to Tyler Sanjenko’s home to pick up some alcohol and continued on to the home of the appellant and Teanda Manchur.  They arrived prior to 4 a.m. and spent the next while drinking, looking at the appellant’s motorcycles in his garage and touring his house.  [6]At about 4 a.m., Larry Hubick and Chantel Huel left to go to a house party on Winnipeg Street.  When they left, Teanda Manchur was in the house dancing by herself to music which was playing on the computer.  [7]The appellant and Tyler Sanjenko decided to follow Larry Hubick and his wife on two of the appellant’s motorcycles. According to the testimony of Tyler Sanjenko, the appellant seemed to ride fine at first but then began weaving.  He was nonetheless able to reach the home of a friend, James Beamish, go inside, have a brief visit and a beer.  Mr. Beamish testified to the appellant being “pretty intoxicated”.  He testified that the appellant had difficulty keeping his balance, stumbled up the stairs and had to hold onto a counter to hold himself up, and had slurred speech.  On departing, the appellant put his helmet on backwards and had difficulty putting on his boots.  However, upon leaving his friend’s house, he was able to back his bike out of the driveway and catch up with Larry Hubick at or near the party location.  On the way there, however, the appellant crashed his motorcycle while travelling about five miles an hour and suffered some minor bumps and scrapes; he needed help to pick up his bike.  Discovering there was no party, the Hubicks went home and the appellant and Tyler Sanjenko went back to the appellant’s house.  The appellant dropped his motorcycle again outside his garage.  [8]Tyler Sanjenko parked the motorcycles and then discovered the appellant urinating against the neighbour’s fence.  The appellant appeared to have difficulty getting his pants up afterwards and walked around with them down. Mr. Sanjenko described the appellant as being “pretty out of it” at this point, but the two of them were still able to talk for several minutes about their plans for the next day to attend a car show together. Following this, Tyler Sanjenko left the appellant at the door of his house and went home.  [9]After Tyler Sanjenko left, the appellant showed up across the street at the home of his new neighbour, James Clarke.  Evidently intoxicated and unsteady on his feet, he woke up his neighbour and welcomed him to the neighbourhood.  He was obviously drunk and went up and down the stairs a few times repeating the greetings and then stumbled away.  [10]Other neighbours observed the appellant.  Mr. Jack Mohr was awakened by the motorcycles returning and after that heard the appellant yell “Let me in, you fuckin’ bitch.”  Mrs. Mohr was awake reading and saw the appellant outside, apparently trying to get into his home, around 5 a.m.  She heard him yelling the same phrase about five times.  She also observed the appellant unsuccessfully trying to get in each of his four vehicles outside the house.  She described the appellant as appearing “really intoxicated” and witnessed him fall once during this time.  She then went back to her reading.  [11]The appellant’s sister testified that she arrived at the appellant’s home around 7:30 or 7:40 on the morning of the 24th of April with the children and discovered Teanda dead in the dining room area.  The victim’s shirt was pushed up to just below her breasts, she had no clothing on her lower body, her legs were spread and her knees were up.  The appellant’s sister put a towel over her.  She followed a trail of blood leading from where she found the body to the bathroom and found the appellant down the hall in a bedroom smelling of alcohol and unresponsive.  [12]The appellant’s sister phoned her father, who arrived shortly thereafter.  Her father checked to see if the victim was breathing and concluded she was not.  He testified he tried to wake the appellant who reeked of alcohol, but was unable to waken him.  He testified that he feared his son was dead.  He asked a friend who had come with him to the appellant’s house to phone for help.  [13]Paramedics arrived and confirmed the victim was dead.  They observed the appellant’s father to be walking back and forth through the blood trail.  One of the paramedics heard the appellant and his father talking in the bedroom while she and her partner worked on the victim.  The other paramedic observed two knives with broken blades in the living room.  [14]One of the paramedics, Ms. Ackles, went to check on the appellant.  She found him lying on the bed staring at the ceiling while partly covered by a blanket.  He appeared nude.  She saw blood on him, and on the bedding, and asked if he was hurt.  She testified that she believed the appellant said he “was only mentally injured”.  [15]The police arrived at about 7:50 a.m.  Constable Decterow made observations similar to the paramedic regarding the deceased and the blood trail.  She saw a broken knife in the living room.  She found the appellant intoxicated, but awake, in the back bedroom, staring at the ceiling.  After some mumbled conversation during which the appellant identified himself and told her he was not hurt, Constable Decterow arrested him for murder.  The appellant made the following statement which was admitted as a voluntary statement at the trial:  He said, “Teanda and I were fighting but I didn’t hurt her.”  I asked, “Who did?”  Mr. Daley said, “Whoever jumped in.”  He then said, “I’m sorry,” and I asked, “What are you sorry about?”  Mr. Daley said, “I’ll take [the] guilt over it.  I’ll take the blame.”  I asked, “Why?”  His response was, “Why not?”  Mr. Daley then said, “Sorry about that.”  I asked, “What are you sorry about?”  Mr. Daley said, “Well, fuck, fighting with her.  It’s just beyond bullshit.  You get in a fight and it’s beyond bullshit.  You have kids, you know.”  I asked, “Were you fighting about the kids?”  And he gave no response and at that point that was the end of the exchange.  [A.R., at p. 129]  After making this statement, the appellant asked the police several times if his wife was o.k. and if she could bail him out.  He was also described as reacting with surprise to later hearing that his wife was dead.  [16]An autopsy was performed on Teanda which revealed that she had suffered a two-centimeter-deep stab wound to the back of her leg.  There was a corresponding hole in her blood-covered jeans that were found elsewhere in the house.  That wound was not fatal.  Teanda died from blood lost as a result of a second stab wound located on her right side some 21 centimetres deep between the ninth and tenth rib, angling downwards through her lung and liver.  Death likely would have come within a half hour although prompt medical attention could have saved her.  [17]The appellant testified and denied any memory of the events after arriving home at around 5 a.m.  He essentially confirmed the events of the evening as testified to by others up to the point of arriving at his home for the first time around 4 a.m.  After that he testified things became a little bit hazy.  He does not remember taking his motorcycle out of the garage but does remember starting it in the alley.  He stated he does not remember the ride to his friend James Beamish’s residence on the other side of the city except for falling off his motorcycle.  The next thing he remembers is going into the police cells.  He has no recollection of going home or interacting with his neighbour Mr. Clarke.  Mr. Daley claimed he is only an occasional drinker who avoided hard liquor.  The estimates of his consumption range from 30 drinks of alcohol (Tyler Sanjenko) to between 36 and 40 (the appellant) to 49 ounces (Larry Hubick) consisting mostly of whiskey.  He was given a breathalyzer test at 11:54 a.m. on April 24 and tested 0.10.  At 12:13 p.m. he tested 0.09.  He does not remember speaking to or giving a statement to the police officer.  [18]Dr. Richardson, a pharmacologist, testified for the defence as an expert on the effects of beverage alcohol on the human body, brain functioning and behaviour.  He testified that some brain cells, such as those responsible for judgment and evaluation of appropriateness, are more sensitive to alcohol than others: ",

        ],
        "Facts": " [6]On September 20, 2005, Jill Marie McIvor was sentenced to a 12-month conditional sentence for a number of property-related offences.  Among other conditions, the conditional sentence order required that Ms. McIvor:  (1) not be in the direct company of her co‑accused without permission from her sentence supervisor; (2) unless authorized in writing by her supervisor, or required to be outside her residence for abona fidemedical emergency, obey a curfew between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.; (3) keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and (4) not possess identification, credit cards, cheques or documents in any name other than her own.  It is alleged that Ms. McIvor breached these four conditions.  [7]The facts in support of the alleged breaches all arise out of a motor vehicle collision which occurred during the late evening hours of September 25, 2005.  It is alleged that the circumstances surrounding the collision reveal that:  (1) Ms. McIvor was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her co-accused, Dean Pelley; (2) she was outside of her residence past her curfew; (3) she was in possession of stolen property located in the vehicle; and (4) some of the stolen property included identification and other documents in the names of third parties.  [8]At the breach hearing, the Crown relied exclusively on the supervisor’s report, adduced in accordance with the notice and service requirements under s. 742.6(5) and (6).  The report, signed by the supervisor, set out the relevant conditions and stated that Jill Marie McIvor had not been given permission to be out beyond her curfew or to be in contact with her co-accused.  Attached to the supervisor’s report was a comprehensive police report prepared by the investigating officer, summarizing the information obtained from several witnesses concerning the circumstances surrounding the motor vehicle collision.  The witnesses named in the report included Ms. McIvor’s co‑accused, some eyewitnesses to the collision, police officers attending at the scene, and the persons who identified as their property the items found in the car occupied by Ms. McIvor and her co‑accused.  No signed statements from any of these witnesses was included in the police officer’s report.  The investigating officer who prepared the report was not himself a witness to any of the material facts and his report was not signed.  It simply concluded with the typewritten words:  “Respectfully Submitted.  Cst. Paul DOUGLAS #160 Traffic Safety Unit”.  [9]On a preliminary motion, Ms. McIvor’s counsel sought a dismissal of the breach allegations on the ground that the supervisor had failed to include “signed statements of witnesses” with his report, contrary to s. 742.6(4).  The hearing judge rejected this argument, holding that the comprehensive police report was a formal document created by investigators for the use of prosecutors and that it would not be “appropriate” for the court to “insist on a technicality of the signature given the overall scheme of the section dealing with conditional sentence breaches and the nature of the document itself”.  He proceeded with the hearing, found Ms. McIvor in breach, terminated the conditional sentence order and committed her to custody until the expiration of her sentence.  [10]The hearing judge’s decision was overturned by a majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  Smith J.A. held that the hearing judge seemingly misapprehended Ms. McIvor’s argument by focussing on whether the report to Crown counsel was signed, rather than on its contents.  Smith J.A. found it unnecessary to decide whether the report was “signed” by Constable Douglas because, in his view, the comprehensive police report could not be a witness statement within the meaning of s. 742.6(4) because a “witness” is a person present at an event and able to give information about it.  “Statements of witnesses” must then refer to written accounts of the facts alleged to constitute a breach prepared by persons having knowledge of those facts.  That s. 742.6(8) allows the offender, with leave, to cross-examine the supervisor and any witness whose statement is included, lent further support to this interpretation.  The supervisor’s report lacked signed statements of witnesses, and could therefore not be admitted in evidence.  Accordingly, Smith J.A. set aside the order of the hearing judge and restored the conditional sentence.  [11]Hall J.A. dissented, holding that Constable Douglas’s report was functionally equivalent to a signed witness statement.  He noted that the comprehensive police report was very detailed, seemed reliable on its face, and provided sufficient information to allow Ms. McIvor to challenge its contents.  In his view, Ms. McIvor could apply to have any witness attend before the court for cross‑examination and therefore there was no possible unfairness in the hearing proceedings.  Hall J.A. found that the majority’s approach elevated form over substance, and did not accord with Parliament’s intent to create an expeditious breach process.

        "Facts": " [4]The encounter at the centre of this appeal occurred at mid-day on November 17, 2003, in the Greenwood and Danforth area of Toronto.  With  four schools in the area and a history of student assaults, robberies, and drug offences occurring over the lunch hour, the three officers involved in the encounter were on patrol for the purposes of monitoring the area and maintaining a safe student environment. Two of the officers, Constables Worrell and Forde, were dressed in plainclothes and driving an unmarked car. Although on patrol, their primary task was to visit the various schools to determine if there were persons on school property who should not have been there — either non-students or students from another school. The third officer, Constable Gomes, was in uniform and driving a marked police car.  On “directed patrol”, he had been tasked with maintaining a visible police presence in the area in order to provide student reassurance and to deter crime during the high school lunch period.  [5]Mr. Grant, a young black man, was walking northbound on Greenwood Avenue when he came to the attention of Constables Worrell and Forde.  As the two officers drove past, Cst. Worrell testified that the appellant “stared” at them in an unusually intense manner and continued to do so as they proceeded down the street, while at the same time “fidgeting” with his coat and pants in a way that aroused their suspicions.  Given their purpose for being in the area and based on what he had just seen, Cst. Worrell decided that “maybe we should have a chat with this guy and see what’s up with him”.  Cst. Worrell wanted to know whether Mr. Grant was a student at one of the schools they were assigned to monitor, and, if he was not, whether he was headed to one of the schools anyway.  Noticing Cst. Gomes parked on the street ahead of Mr. Grant, and in light of his uniformed attire, the two plainclothes officers suggested to Cst. Gomes that he “have a chat” with the approaching appellant to determine if there was any need for concern.  [6]Cst. Gomes then got out of his car and initiated an exchange with Mr. Grant, while standing on the sidewalk directly in his intended path.  The officer asked the appellant “what was going on”, and requested his name and address.  In response, the appellant provided a provincial health card.  At one point, the appellant, behaving nervously, adjusted his jacket, prompting the officer to ask him to “keep his hands in front of him”.  By this point, the two other officers had returned and parked on the side of the street.  [7]Cst. Worrell testified on cross‑examination that he and Cst. Forde pulled up because he got a funny feeling based on Mr. Grant’s way of looking over at them, looking around “all over the place”, and adjusting himself. On direct examination he said that “[h]e still seemed to be, I don’t know, looking a bit nervous the way he was looking around, looking at us, looking around when speaking to Officer Gomes. And at this time, I suggested to my partner, you know, I don’t think it would hurt if we just go up to Officer Gomes and just stand by, just to make sure everything was okay.” Thus, after a brief period observing the exchange from their car, the two officers approached the pair on the sidewalk, identified themselves to the appellant as police officers by flashing their badges, and took up positions behind Cst. Gomes, obstructing the way forward.  The exchange between Cst. Gomes and Mr. Grant subsequent to the arrival of the two officers was as follows:  Q.   Have you ever been arrested before?  A.   I got into some trouble about three years ago.  Q.   Do you have anything on you that you shouldn’t?  A.   No. Well, I got a small bag of weed.  Q.   Where is it?  A.   It’s in my pocket.  Q.   Is that it?  A.   (Male puts his head down.) Yeah. Well, no.  Q.   Do you have other drugs on you?  A.   No, I just have the weed, that’s it.  Q.   Well, what is it that you have?  A.   I have a firearm.  [8]At this point, the officers arrested and searched the appellant, seizing the marijuana and a loaded revolver.  They then advised Mr. Grant of his right to counsel and took him to the police station.",

            "[1]                              The Crown appeals the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal setting aside the conviction of the respondent for the sexual assault of his stepdaughter.  The complainant and the accused were the principal witnesses.  The majority judgment of the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had insufficiently instructed the jury on their duty, even if they disbelieved the accused, to determine whether the Crown had proved on the whole of the evidence every element of the charge against him to the criminal standard of proof.  In other words, the majority concluded that the jury was not clearly instructed that lack of credibility on the part of the accused does not equate to proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as required by R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, Saunders J.A., was of the view that the jury instruction on this point left no room for misunderstanding about the correct burden and standard of proof to apply.  That is the bottom line.  I agree with him and would allow the appeal.",

            "[8]                              A series of decisions over at least the past 20 years has affirmed and reaffirmed the proposition that where credibility is a central issue in a jury trial, the judge must explain the relationship between the assessment of credibility and the Crown’s ultimate burden to prove the guilt of the accused to the criminal standard.  A general instruction on reasonable doubt without adverting to its relationship to the credibility (or lack of credibility) of the witnesses leaves open too great a possibility of confusion or misunderstanding.  The so-called W. (D.) instruction has long roots:  R. v. Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 556; R. v. Chan (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 186; R. v.

Levasseur, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 518 (upholding Fish J.A.’s dissent reported at (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 508 (Que. C.A.), at p. 534).  W. (D.) has been cited by Canadian courts at all levels in no fewer than 3,743 subsequent reported cases.  It has proven to be a fertile source of appellate review.  For a recent application, see R. v. C.L.Y., [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, 2008 SCC 2.",
            "If that formula were followed, the oft repeated error which appears in the recharge in this case would be avoided.  The requirement that the Crown prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt is fundamental in our system of criminal law.  Every effort should be made to avoid mistakes in charging the jury on this basic principle."

        "Facts": " [2]The respondent was the stepfather of the complainant.  The complainant testified that the respondent, who lived in the same house along with  her sister and their mother, started sexually abusing her when she was approximately four years old.  The abuse went on consistently, and intensified from touching to intercourse as she got older  (A.R., at pp. 142-45).  When she was eight-and-a-half years old and again when she was almost 15, the complainant told her mother about the assault, but the mother did not believe her on either occasion, at least initially.  Eventually, the mother told the respondent to leave the house.  At the age of 15, the complainant went to the police.  [3]The complainant’s mother testified that when the complainant was about 13, she began to hang around with a rough crowd that was breaking into houses and mailboxes.  She was smoking, drinking, had a lot of problems with her teachers and the principal at school, and rebelled at everything.  According to her sister, the complainant went from being “kind of a good little apple to a bad apple” as she got older (A.R., at p. 358).  The sister described the relationship between her mother and the complainant as “very rocky”, and living with them as “sheer chaos” (A.R., at p. 362).  [4]The accused denied all allegations of impropriety.  The defence theory was that the complainant began to act up when her biological father first came back into her life when she was about 11 years old.  Shortly afterwards he again ceased contact with her.  The complainant felt rejected.  In response to her uncontrollable behaviour, the respondent threatened to send her to a Catholic school, which the defence says prompted her false allegations of sexual assault (A.R., at pp. 126-27).

        "Facts": " [3]In September 2004, Mr. Dinardo, a cab driver, picked up the complainant at a home for mentally challenged persons in Longueuil called the “Auberge” and drove her to the “Maison des jeunes” in Boucherville.  During the 15-minute drive to the Maison des jeunes, the accused allegedly touched the complainant’s breasts, put his finger inside her vagina and said [translation] “That smells good” (A.R., at p. 137).  The complainant further alleged that Mr. Dinardo invited her to touch his penis, which she refused.  [4]The complainant, who was 22 years old at the time of trial, is mildly mentally challenged and suffers from Tourette syndrome.  When the alleged incident occurred, she was residing at the Auberge during the week.  It was common for residents of the home to visit the Maison des jeunes for activities during the day.  As a general rule, residents were transported back and forth in taxis.  [5]When the complainant arrived at the Maison des jeunes, she spontaneously recounted the alleged events to a teacher.  When she returned to the Auberge that afternoon, she made a similar statement to an employee of the home.  The taxi driver who dropped off the complainant witnessed this statement.  Later that day, the complainant told the same story to a second employee of the home.  [6]Mr. Dinardo was charged with sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a person with a disability contrary toss. 271(1)(a) and153.1(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  At the commencement of the trial, the court held avoir direto determine whether the complainant was competent to testify.  During the course of her testimony on thevoir dire, the complainant contradicted herself on the question of whether she knew what it meant to tell the truth.  She first stated that she did not understand the importance of telling the truth.  She subsequently testified that she knew what it meant to lie and that lying was wrong.  She stated that if she did not remember the answer to a question, she would simply say [translation]“I don’t remember” (A.R., at pp. 110-11).  [7]When the complainant was asked on cross-examination whether she ever invented stories, she stated that she sometimes invented stories [translation] “[to] be funny” (A.R., at p. 112).  An example of the [translation]“silly things” she sometimes said was that a friend “kicked me in the ass . . . in the behind, but it’s not true” (A.R., at p. 112).  The complainant provided inconsistent answers on the frequency with which she told these types of stories, but said that her foster family reprimanded her when she did so.  [8]In response to defence counsel’s argument that it was apparent that [translation] “she can be made to say almost anything” (A.R., at p. 123), the trial judge held that while the complainant’s deficiency was apparent, it did not mean that she could not testify and it would be up to him to determine her credibility.  He therefore ruled that the complainant was competent to testify on a promise to tell the truth.  No issue is raised with respect to this ruling; however, the obvious difficulties demonstrated during the course of the complainant’svoir diretestimony and the trial judge’s acknowledgement that any issue of credibility would have to be ultimately resolved by him at trial provide relevant context for assessing the sufficiency of the trial judge’s reasons on appellate review.  [9]The complainant testified at trial and provided essentially consistent answers on the central parts of her allegations.  She also identified the accused by his first name (Jean) and by a tattoo on his right arm.  However, on many points, the complainant gave contradictory answers, much as she had done in the course of hervoir diretestimony.  She also gave this troubling evidence on cross-examination (A.R., at pp. 174-75):  [translation]  Q         This story you told Ms. Thériault on arriving at the Maison des Jeunes, is it possible that it, that the story was made up?  A         Yes. Q         Why did you make the story up? A         Well, I made it up to say he touched me. Q         You made it up to say he touched you? A         Yes. Q         Why?  You didn’t like him? A         No, I didn’t like him. Q         Why? A         I was afraid of him. Q         You were afraid of him.  Because he had tattoos? A         Yes.  [10]In re-examination, the complainant testified as follows (A.R., at pp. 181-82):  [translation]  Q         . . . listen to me carefully.  He said: “Is it possible that you made up the story you told Nicole Thériault?” A         Oh, I didn’t make it up. Q         Okay.  But you said yes.  Do you know . . . what do you mean by that?  What is . . . explain that, about that.  A         I didn’t make it up. Q         Okay.  Your sentence, it was: “I made it up – after what he said to you – to say he touched me”.  A         Yes. Q         What do you mean by that? A         He touched me. Q         Okay.  But when you told her that, told Nicole Thériault that, was it made up?  Had you made it up?  A         No.  [11]At the end of the complainant’s testimony, the trial judge asked the following questions (A.R., at p. 182):  [translation]  BY THE COURT  I have one, X. Can you tell me what it means to “make something up”?  A         I don’t know.  Q         You don’t know, eh?  So when you answered earlier that, that you made it up, you don’t know what that means?  A         No.  [12]Four witnesses gave evidence at trial regarding the complainant’s account of the allegations.  Ms. Thériault, a teacher at the Maison des jeunes, testified that the complainant stated immediately upon her arrival that [translation] “[t]he taxi driver touched me” (A.R., at p. 210).  The taxi driver who brought the complainant back to the Auberge at the end of the day stated that during the trip, the complainant told him that [translation] “[t]his morning, the driver who brought me here, he touched my breast” (A.R., at p. 246).  When they arrived at the Auberge, the driver witnessed the complainant recount the alleged events to Ms. Lussier, the assistant director of the home.  Ms. Duquette, the complainant’s [translation] “attendant” at the Auberge, stated that the complainant confided to her that same day that she had been “assaulted” by the taxi driver (A.R., at p. 284).  Ms. Duquette discussed the allegations with the assistant director of the home, and according to Ms. Duquette, [translation] “the story was the same for both of us” (A.R., at p. 285).  [13]Two of the witnesses also testified that the complainant had a history of lying.  Ms. Thériault stated that she did not initially believe the complainant [translation] “because she is manipulative” (A.R., at p. 214).  She also stated that the complainant lied from time to time when she was looking for attention.  When she lied, however, [translation] “she admitted it.  She knew the difference” (A.R., at p. 229).  This led Ms. Thériault to believe that there was some truth to the allegations.  Ms. Duquette also testified that the complainant had a history of lying.  When she was being untruthful, she would blush or confuse what she was saying.  On this occasion, however, the complainant had repeated the same story several times to different people.  For this reason, Ms. Duquette believed that the complainant was being truthful.  Both witnesses also testified that the complainant’s behaviour on the date of the alleged offence was out of character.  [14]Mr. Dinardo testified and denied the allegations against him.  He stated that when he arrived at the Auberge, the complainant was brought out to the taxi and an employee of the home fastened her seatbelt.  The employee placed the complainant’s hands between her legs to prevent her from hitting herself or the cab driver because of her condition.  He testified that her hands remained between her legs for the duration of the trip.  [15]Mr. Dinardo also testified that the configuration of the car was such that it would have been impossible for him to touch the complainant without leaning over.  Mr. Dinardo testified that he had no prior convictions of this nature, and had never had any complaints as a taxi driver.  [16]In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge summarized the evidence of the witnesses for the Crown and the defence:  C.Q. Longueuil, No. 505-01-053038-044, March 30, 2006.  After recalling the test inR. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, and the Crown’s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge made his findings on credibility.  He stated that while the accused had [translation] “testified well” (para. 46),  he did not believe the accused’s “argument” that [translation] “it was impossible for him to touch the passenger because of the console, the coffee cup and his note book” (para. 54).  He rejected this argument on the basis of the photographs produced by Mr. Dinardo and the fact that the complainant had been able to see the tattoo on his right forearm.  [17]The trial judge then considered the complainant’s credibility.  He did not refer to the evidence that the complainant, by her own admission, had a tendency to lie. Rather, he observed only that [translation] “[w]hen cross-examined by counsel for the accused, she never contradicted herself on important facts, only on certain details that the Court does not consider important enough for the contradictions to affect her credibility” (para. 70).  He placed significant emphasis on the fact that the complainant’s version of the events was consistent, noting that [translation] “in this case, there is a form of corroboration in the facts and statements of the victim, who never contradicted herself” (para. 68).  He also noted that the complainant’s statement was made spontaneously upon her arrival at the Maison des jeunes.  The accused was convicted of both offences.  [18]A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: [2007] Q.J. No. 1320 (QL), 2007 QCCA 287.  Rochon J.A., Côté J.A. concurring, held that although the trial judge’s reasons were succinct, they made it clear why the trial judge disbelieved Mr. Dinardo.  While the trial judge did not explicitly direct himself on the second step ofW. (D.), the test is not a [translation] “sacrosanct formula” (para. 29).  It was implicit in the trial judge’s rejection of the accused’s evidence that his evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt.  While it may have been preferable to state this explicitly, his failure to do so was not an error of law.  [19]The majority then observed that the complainant’s testimony should be evaluated having regard to her mental disability.  Rochon J.A. reviewed ten inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence identified by Mr. Dinardo, including the complainant’s testimony about inventing stories.  None of these inconsistencies were specifically addressed by the trial judge.  Rochon J.A. concluded that the inconsistencies related primarily to peripheral aspects of the case.   With respect to the complainant’s testimony about telling stories, the majority stated that [translation] “[e]ven if I were to conclude that this last piece of evidence required an explanation by the judge, a review of the evidence on these questions would enable a court of appeal to review the soundness of the decision” (para. 73).  [20]The majority also held that the trial judge erred in using the complainant’s prior consistent statements to corroborate her evidence that a crime had been committed.  The majority concluded, however, that the improper use of the statements did not justify ordering a new trial because the accused suffered no prejudice.  [21]Chamberland J.A., in dissent, noted that despite stating twice that the accused had [translation] “testified well”, the trial judge found Mr. Dinardo guilty without explaining why he rejected Mr. Dinardo’s denial of guilt.  Although he explained why he disbelieved Mr. Dinardo’s evidence that he could not have touched the complainant because of the configuration of his car, the trial judge did not discuss the most important aspect of Mr. Dinardo’s testimony —  that is, his denial of the allegations.  [22]Chamberland J.A. also concluded that the trial judge erred in failing to explicitly consider the second step of theW. (D.)test — even if he did not believe the “argument” of the accused, he failed to consider whether he was left in reasonable doubt by the accused’s testimony.  There was no corroborating evidence in the case and the complainant’s testimony was problematic.  Chamberland J.A. was particularly concerned about the exchange at the end of the complainant’s cross‑examination in which she stated that she invented the allegations [translation] “to say he touched me” (para. 116).  Chamberland J.A. noted that more than one witness testified that the complainant had a history of lying.  In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to explicitly address the accused’s denial of the allegations.  Chamberland J.A. would have ordered a new trial.

First, he drew the jury’s attention to the problematic testimony. Second, he explained why there was a greater risk that the witnesses’ testimony was unreliable given their lifestyles and criminal backgrounds. Third, he said that it would be dangerous to convict the accused on the basis of the testimony in question in the absence of confirmation by other evidence. The charge was complete. The trial judge gave no instructions regarding independence or materiality, and that was the correct approach.

The defence further argued that any fabricated statements in the letters were not evidence of guilt, but were rather the conduct of an innocent man, distrustful of police, who was attempting to exonerate himself of the murder charge while not betraying his involvement in other criminal activity.",
            "[21]                          The question, then, is whether this potential for jury confusion warrants a new trial.  It is well established that an improper jury instruction constitutes an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and that a new trial may be granted as a remedy under s. 686(2)(b) unless the harmless error proviso of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) applies.  The Court has repeatedly held that the proviso can only be invoked with respect to “errors of a minor nature having no impact on the verdict” or “serious errors which would justify a new trial, but for the fact that the evidence adduced was seen as so overwhelming that the reviewing court concludes that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” (R. v. Trochym, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, 2007 SCC 6, at para. 81 (Deschamps J., for the majority), quoting R. v. Khan, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, 2001 SCC 86, at para. 26 (Arbour J., for the majority)).  More succinctly, “the proviso should only be applied where ‘the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict”’ (R. v. Charlebois, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, 2000 SCC 53, at para. 11 (Bastarache J., for the majority), quoting R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 916 (Sopinka J., for the majority)).",
            "[37]                          Unlike Justice Charron, we are not persuaded “that the defence’s failure to seek [Maze] out as a witness suggests that he had no helpful evidence to offer” (para. 69).  Without the benefit of the undisclosed evidence, the defence was in no position to make the informed decision to which it was entitled by law.  In this case, the failure of the defence to approach Mr. Maze is entirely understandable.  Without the undisclosed evidence, the defence had no reason to expect that Maze, a drug trafficker, would testify  truthfully as to the circumstances in which he saw the severed head in the bucket.  Furthermore, the defence and the Crown would both know from the disclosure that Mr. Maze had given some of the relevant evidence as a Crown witness in the R. v. Polo case (see B.C. Court of Appeal judgment, at paras. 106-7).  It seems reasonable to expect that this could well have tempered any concerns the defence might have had that he would become an easy target for impeachment, in view of his criminal past.  Defence counsel’s failure to seek him out may well have reflected these considerations — both of which would have been mitigated had the withheld evidence been disclosed — rather than a determination that Mr. Maze’s evidence would have been unhelpful.",
            "[51]                          On appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Mr. Illes argued that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the incriminating aspects of the accused’s statements could be weighed in a way different from the excuses contained in the statements.  The court accepted this argument, stating that, although arguably correct at the time it was given, in light of the court’s later decision in David this type of instruction should no longer be given to juries.  However, while a similar instruction effectively took away the defence in David, Donald J.A., Chiasson J.A. concurring, concluded that the same could not be said in the case at bar.  The majority was of the view that:  “[r]ealistically, the appellant could derive no tangible benefit from his protestations of innocence within the context of so many obvious falsehoods” ((2007), 237 B.C.A.C. 231, 2007 BCCA 125, at para. 20).  Donald J.A. noted that defence counsel made only a passing reference to the exculpatory aspects of the letters in his final address to the jury.  Moreover, there were no inculpatory admissions in the letters upon which the presumption could operate.  Although concluding that the trial judge erred by giving the impugned instruction, the majority applied the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ."
        ],
        "Facts": " [44]The victim was shot four times in the back of the head.  Mr. Illes was charged with first degree murder in respect of his death.  The defence conceded at trial that the shooting took place in a van and that the only occupants of the van at the time of the shooting were the victim, Mr. Illes and Derrick Madinsky.  All three individuals were involved in the drug trade.  Mr. Madinsky agreed to testify for the Crown at Mr. Illes’s trial in exchange for immunity and witness protection.  Mr. Madinsky admitted that he and another drug associate, Garry Favell, disposed of the deceased’s body but testified that Mr. Illes was the shooter.  Mr. Illes did not testify but took the position at trial that Mr. Madinsky was the shooter.  [45]A significant feature of this case is that the victim’s head was severed, kept in a plastic bucket and moved from place to place until it was buried several days later, separate from the rest of the body.  Melanie Ovalle, a friend of Mr. Illes’s then girlfriend and later wife, testified that Mr. Illes put the bucket with the severed head in her garage for a day before moving it to another location.  When she asked why the victim was dead, Mr. Illes said he had to be dealt with because he was taking some of the cocaine from deliveries to feed his own habit.  Mr. Illes had therefore shot him.  In his account of the events, Mr. Madinsky also described the extent and nature of his own connection with the bucket containing the severed head.  In essence, he denied ever having seen the bucket at his own apartment, but admitted his involvement in disposing of the remains. His testimony on this point acquires greater significance in the context of the fresh evidence application, and I will therefore review it in more detail later in these reasons.  [46]Mr. Illes was arrested based on information Ms. Ovalle gave to the police. While in custody, Mr. Illes wrote several letters to his friends.  The letters were introduced in evidence by the Crown and their contents are the subject matter of the impugned jury instruction on out-of-court statements.  [47]In his letters, Mr. Illes proclaimed his innocence, implicating at first Ms. Ovalle and later Mr. Madinsky as the killer.  It was conceded at trial that the letters were a ruse, as they were intended to fall in the hands of the police and provide a paper defence.  This plan was revealed by one of the letters — not intended to be discovered by the police — in which Mr. Illes gave his girlfriend instructions on how to engineer the discovery of the fake letters by the police.  The Crown relied on the fabrication of the letters as post-offence conduct tending to prove guilt.  Although admitting that the letters were a ruse, the defence argued that the expressions of innocence contained in the letters were nonetheless truthful.  2.1The Jury Instructions  [48]At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge gave a strongVetrovecwarning in connection with Mr. Madinsky’s testimony (Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811).  She explained that Mr. Madinsky was an accomplice by virtue of his role in disposing of the victim’s body, and that he had been granted immunity in exchange for testifying at Mr. Illes’s trial.  She also noted that Mr. Madinsky admitted to committing perjury at the preliminary hearing and to lying to both the police and the prosecution.  The trial judge told the jury that, given the many reasons for doubting Mr. Madinsky’s veracity as a witness, it would be dangerous to rely on his evidence in the absence of some confirmation.  Mr. Illes argued in the Court of Appeal, among other things, that the trial judge had erred by pointing out an excessive number of examples of evidence capable of supporting Mr. Madinsky’s testimony.  The court unanimously rejected this ground of appeal, and the correctness of theVetrovecinstruction is no longer in issue.  As it relates to jury instructions, the appeal before this Court is only concerned with the trial judge’s instruction to the jury on the weight they may give to the statements in Mr. Illes’s letters.  [49]As stated earlier, the Crown relied on the fabrication of the letters as post‑offence conduct from which guilt could be inferred.  Although the letters were admitted fabrications, the defence argued that the proclamations of innocence contained in the letters were nonetheless true.  The trial judge therefore instructed the jury on the weight to be given to the statements contained in the letters as follows: ",

        "Facts": " [5]In November 1995, a “wholesale” drug supplier named Myles Skolos received a large shipment of marijuana at the farm where he lived with his wife, Pirkko.  They hid the marijuana in three trunks at a “stash”.  Some time later he left to attend his brother’s funeral on Vancouver Island leaving his wife behind.  When he returned, his wife was missing, as were her wallet and some cheques.  The footprints of himself and his wife and those of at least one other person could be seen in the snow leading to the location of the stash.  Two of the trunks and all of the marijuana were gone.  [6]When the police searched the farm, it appeared that a large truck or vehicle had driven up the driveway, but no distinctive tire pattern imprints could be identified. There was no sign of a struggle or blood at the farmhouse or at the stash.  An extensive search of the farm by a tracking dog failed to locate the victim’s body.  [7]The police learned from Bill Wall, the brother of a major Skolos customer, that he might have told the appellant about the arrival of the shipment.  The appellant had a substantial record as a drug dealer and an enforcer.  The police interviewed the appellant and intercepted his private communications.  The appellant denied knowing of the shipment.  He admitted having been to the farm on earlier occasions but denied going there around the time when the victim disappeared.  [8]Over a period of several months, the appellant gave information and alibis to the police that he later admitted were false.  However, on January 19, 2000, on the eve of trial, the appellant entered into a Limited Immunity Agreement with the police.  In it he promised to cooperate fully with the investigation and to show police the location of the victim’s body, which he said he had buried in order to assist Bill Wall who was the “real” murderer.  In return, the Crown agreed that the appellant would not be charged with first degree murder in connection with the death. The body was never found, despite the instructions given by the appellant and extensive police searching.  Bill Wall denied any involvement.  The Crown continued with the first degree murder charge.  [9]The appellant’s statement of January 19, 2000 was generally consistent with his testimony at trial.  He said that he and Bill Wall had discussed for many months a plan to steal the Skolos marijuana using a gun to secure “co-operation”.  He claimed to have met Bill Wall by coincidence on November 23, who told him that the plan was “a go” that night.  Wall told him the marijuana had arrived at the Skolos farm and that he and an associate were going to go and get it.  The appellant was not going to participate in the rip-off, according to Wall, but they would all meet together later that night.  [10]The appellant testified that when Bill Wall eventually arrived with two trunks of marijuana, Wall said that he had accidentally shot Mrs. Skolos.  According to the appellant, Wall had told him the gun went off accidentally as he and the victim were walking back to the house from the stash but that he “just kept shooting her” and “just lost it”.  [11]The appellant testified that he and Wall lifted the trunks of marijuana out of Wall’s truck and put them into a shed. The appellant also said he told Wall that he would bury the victim’s body in a hole he had already dug for someone else (a target in a different dispute).  The appellant later went back and retrieved the trunks after Wall had left.  He testified that after burying the victim (noting the blood on the back of her head) he covered over the hole with debris and leaves to make the ground look unaltered. Then he returned to his girlfriend at a motel loaded with the marijuana and cash.  [12]Bill Wall testified at length.  He denied everything.  He said he never  discussed ripping off the marijuana shipment at the Skolos farm with the appellant.  He had no reason to do so.  He had a profitable ongoing business relationship with the victim and her husband.  [13]The appellant’s girlfriend testified that on the night in question, he left their motel room for about eight hours and returned with two trunks filled with marijuana and a great deal of new-found money.  She also led the police to one of the two stolen trunks which the appellant had disposed of by throwing it over an embankment.  Inside this trunk, police found a plastic bag bearing the appellant’s thumbprint.  The plastic bag was identified as being of the same type as the bag in which Myles Skolos kept his personal supply of “bud”.

            "[13] The central issue on this appeal is whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand breath samples from Mr. Shepherd.  Section 254(3)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , requires that an officer have reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence under s. 253 of the Code (impaired driving or over 80) before making a breathalyzer demand.  As this Court explained in R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 51:  “The requirement in s. 254(3) that reasonable and probable grounds exist is not only a statutory but a constitutional requirement as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .”",
            "[16] As noted above, s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code  requires that the officer have reasonable grounds to believe that within the preceding three hours, the accused has committed, or is committing, an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code .  The onus is on the Crown to prove that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand because the Crown seeks to rely on breath samples obtained as a result of a warrantless search.  It would also be impractical to place the burden on the accused because evidence of the presence or absence of reasonable and probable grounds is within the “peculiar knowledge” of the Crown (R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, at p. 210).",
            "[17] As this Court noted in Bernshaw, there is both a subjective and an objective component to establishing reasonable and probable grounds; that is, the officer must have an honest belief that the suspect committed an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code , and there must be reasonable grounds for this belief (Bernshaw, at para. 48).  Here, it is not disputed that the officer had a subjective belief that Mr. Shepherd was intoxicated.  The courts below disagreed, however, on whether the officer’s subjective belief was reasonable in the circumstances.",
            "[23] With respect, it is our view that the trial judge erred in finding that the officer’s subjective belief of impairment was not objectively supported on the facts.  The officer’s belief was based not only on the accused’s erratic driving pattern but also on the various indicia of impairment which he observed after he arrested Mr. Shepherd.  The trial judge placed substantial weight on Mr. Shepherd’s explanation that he thought the police vehicle was an ambulance.  Leaving aside the fact that this confusion itself can be a sign of impairment, it is important to note that the officer need not have anything more than reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the driver committed the offence of impaired driving or driving “over 80” before making the demand. He need not demonstrate a prima facie case for conviction before pursuing his investigation.  In our view, there was ample evidence to support the officer’s subjective belief that Mr. Shepherd had committed an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code .  We therefore conclude that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand, and that Mr. Shepherd’s Charter  claim must fail.",

Sellers approached the vehicle and informed Mr. Shepherd that he was under arrest for failing to stop for the police.  Mr. Shepherd explained that he had not stopped because he thought the police car was an ambulance.  The officer noted that Mr. Shepherd looked lethargic and fatigued and had red eyes.  He could smell alcohol on his breath.  He also noted that his movements and speech were slow and deliberate.  On the basis of these observations, Sgt. Sellers formed the opinion that Mr. Shepherd was “intoxicated”.  The officer read Mr. Shepherd hisCharterrights and made a breathalyzer demand.  [7]Mr. Shepherd was taken to the police station by Cst. Horsley, another officer who arrived at the scene shortly after Mr. Shepherd’s arrest.  On the way there, Mr. Shepherd repeated his explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  Mr. Shepherd provided two breath samples at the police station.  At trial, he moved to have the samples excluded on the basis that they were obtained in violation ofss. 8and9of theCharter.  [8]The trial judge accepted Sgt. Sellers’ evidence that he subjectively believed that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol, but concluded that this belief was not objectively reasonable.  In reaching his decision, the trial judge relied heavily on the accused’s explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  The trial judge noted that this was “just as valid an explanation” for Mr. Shepherd’s erratic driving as the suggestion that he was impaired by alcohol (Appellant’s Record, Part II, at p. 7).  The accused’s explanation also left the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the intention to evade police when he failed to stop.  He acquitted Mr. Shepherd of all charges.  [9]The Crown appealed the acquittals on the impaired driving and driving “over 80” charges to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench. Foley J., the summary conviction appeal judge, upheld the trial judge’s decision (2006 SKQB 91, 30 M.V.R. (5th) 307).  He noted that although the trial judge was wrong to rely on Mr. Shepherd’s explanation to Cst. Horsley since it was given subsequent to Sgt. Sellers’ demand, an “identical explanation” was provided to Sgt. Sellers before the demand was made (para. 12).  Accordingly, Foley J. was of the view that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice.  He also concluded that there was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s “factual finding” that the officer did not have objective grounds to make the demand (para. 16).  He dismissed the appeal.  [10]A majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial (2007 SKCA 29, 45 C.R. (6th) 213).  Sherstobitoff J.A. concluded that on the facts as found by the trial judge, the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  He stated that the trial judge failed to give sufficient consideration to the officer’s opinion that Mr. Shepherd was intoxicated, while at the same time affording undue weight to the accused’s evidence that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  Lane J.A. was in substantial agreement with Sherstobitoff J.A., adding that, in his view, the trial judge’s acceptance of the accused’s explanation for his erratic driving was the result of a misreading of Mr. Shepherd’s obligations under theHighway Traffic Act, S.S. 1986, c. H-3.1.  Even if the police car had in fact been an ambulance as believed by Mr. Shepherd, his conduct would not have complied with the requirements of s. 67(8) of the Act concerning emergency vehicles.  [11]Smith J.A., in dissent, would have dismissed the appeal.  She was of the view that the trial judge made his ruling upon a review of the evidence as a whole, including the fact that Mr. Shepherd appeared to be in complete control of the vehicle while he was driving and the physical indicia of impairment were minimal and inconclusive.  No roadside sobriety test was administered, and some of the officer’s evidence regarding signs of impairment was successfully challenged on cross-examination.  [12]Having found aCharterviolation, Smith J.A. then considered whether the samples should be excluded unders. 24(2)of theCharter.  Smith J.A.’s analysis centered on whether breath samples obtained in breach of theCharterare subject to automatic exclusion as conscriptive evidence, or whether all three categories of factors inR. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, should be considered in deciding whether to exclude the evidence.  She concluded thatR. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, did not create an exception for breath samples; as non-discoverable, conscriptive evidence, they were automatically excluded under the trial fairness branch ofCollins.  After reviewing cases subsequent toStillmanwhich suggest thatStillmannever intended to create an automatic exclusionary rule for conscriptive evidence, Smith J.A. concluded thatStillmanwas still the leading authority on this point, and thus (barring rare exceptions) such evidence should be excluded without considering the second and third branches of theCollinstest.

        "Facts": " [68]The judge in this case faced a difficult problem and he thought that an intermittent sentence of imprisonment was part of the solution. The judge found the offender, Mr. Middleton, guilty after trial of a number of acts of domestic violence arising from two incidents (2006 CarswellOnt 9387). The first, in September 2004, included an assault that left the appellant’s fiancée, who is the mother of his young daughter, with a broken clavicle. The second, in February 2005, included threats and pointing a pellet gun. The judge rightly sought to denounce and deter this sort of senseless brutality and to protect the appellant’s fiancée and others. But he was also concerned about the financial impact of a jail sentence on Mr. Middleton’s daughter. The judge did not want Mr. Middleton’s punishment to deprive his child of the court-ordered financial support he was capable of providing through his well-paid employment.  [69]In an attempt to give effect to these competing objectives, the judge imposed a 90-day period of imprisonment to be served intermittently for the assault and concurrent 18-month conditional sentences for the threatening and pointing of the pellet gun, all to be followed by three years of probation. This, the judge thought, would meet the need to impose “a real jail sentence” while at the same time allowing Mr. Middleton “to maintain [his] employment and to continue to support [his] daughter pursuant to the Court Order” (2006 CarswellOnt 9388, at paras. 6-7).

        "Facts": " [45]K.M. came into the care of the foster home on April 15, 2000. Soon after, on May 2, nurse Michelle De Coene conducted a physical examination of the child. The purpose of this examination was to document any injuries, determine whether any care was needed, and comment on the child’s immunization status. During her examination, Ms. De Coene noticed nothing unusual — K.M. had no bruising, scrapes or cuts, his abdomen was soft, and he showed no indication of soreness or tenderness.  [46]On May 19, R.G., a friend of the foster mother, noticed a bruise in the middle of K.M.’s forehead, marks on his chin and scratches on the top of his head. She was surprised when she saw the scratches, because she had seen none like them on children before, and she drew her sister’s attention to them. However, the thought that K.M.’s foster mother was mistreating him did not occur to her.  [47]Sometime in the month before K.M.’s death, L.K., also a friend of the foster mother, noticed a large bruise on his eye that extended across his face from one cheek to the other. However, L.K. saw K.M. at his home about one week before his death and did not notice any injuries.  [48]J.F.’s mother, Jean F., said that K.M. had visited her home fewer than 10 times during the two months he lived with her son. She testified that her husband had bought K.M. a bicycle and that K.M. had fallen off the bike several times. She had not seen many bruises on K.M., nor had she ever seen either of the foster parents strike him. Jean F. did not really see K.M. during her last visit to the house before his death.  [49]Approximately one week before K.M.’s death, J.K., the foster mother of K.M.’s biological sister, noted that his behaviour was different. She testified that he was acting “scared”. However, K.M. had visited her home twice, and she had not seen any injuries on him.  [50]Three days before K.M.’s death, L.K. and another friend went shopping with the foster mother and K.M. They heard the foster mother call K.M. “stupid”, which L.K. testified was unusual because she did not normally speak to people like that. The other woman heard the foster mother yell at the child again when they returned to the residence.  [51]On Tuesday, June 20, J.F. was home the morning his wife inflicted the wounds that caused K.M.’s death. He told the police that he was sleeping when the injuries occurred and awoke only when his wife came running into the room holding the child, saying that he was not breathing properly. This account of the morning’s events differed from what he told the Chief of the First Nation Territory of Sandy Lake (that his wife came in to tell him something was wrong with the child, whom he found in another room), his mother (that he found the child on the floor), and a friend, D.K. (that he heard a bang and saw the child lying on the floor).  [52]J.F. took K.M. to the local nursing station. When they arrived, the child was not breathing and had no pulse. The nurse, Ms. De Coene, observed that “he had bruises all over his body, to his face, his neck . . . his arms and his legs”. She testified that he had an abrasion on his neck, blueness around his lips, lacerations on his chin, a slightly infected wound at the top of his foot, a swollen nose and dried blood in his right nostril, and that his foreskin was scraped and swollen. She added that she had never before seen a child in this condition and that she was “shocked by the number of bruises” he had.  [53]Despite efforts to save him, K.M. died shortly after arriving at the nursing station.  [54]The cause of death was determined to be multiple blunt traumas to the head. The interval between K.M.’s fatal injuries and his death was between two and three hours. In addition to the multiple blunt traumas to his head, he suffered haemorrhaging in the small bowel. This was caused by the application of significant force. An expert testified that within 10 minutes of suffering these types of injuries, the child would have been crying, his level of consciousness would have been affected, he might have had a seizure and he may have vomited.  [55]The police investigation into K.M.’s death revealed that his blood was on two towels, his bed sheet, a comforter, the wall of his bedroom, the wall of the master bedroom and the bathroom floor. The police also found a child’s t-shirt that was stained and smelled of vomit. There was an indentation in the bathroom wall with several cracks at approximately K.M.’s height. One of his hairs was found imbedded in the cracks, along with traces of his blood. Three knives were found in the bathroom.  [56]J.F. gave three statements to the police — one on the day K.M. died and two the following day. In his third statement, J.F. told the police that on the night before K.M.’s death, he had seen multiple bruises on the child’s legs, arms and chest and a “scratch” on his penis. J.F. said that he had asked K.M. where he got the scratch, and that  K.M. told him the family puppy had bitten his penis. J.F. then asked K.M. to show him where he was hurting, and the child indicated his thighs, chest, arms and the back of his head. J.F. felt the back of K.M.’s head and noted that it felt swollen. K.M. told him that he got the bump by falling off his bike. J.F. also indicated that on the Thursday before K.M.’s death, he had seen bruises on his body but no mark on his penis (A.R., at p. 244).  [57]Both J.F. and his wife were charged in relation to the death. J.F.’s wife admitted to having inflicted the blunt trauma that caused K.M.’s death and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. J.F. was charged, in a single indictment, with two counts of manslaughter, the first by criminal negligence unders. 219of theCriminal Codeand the second by the unlawful act of failing to provide the necessaries of life under s. 215 of theCode. A jury convicted him of manslaughter by criminal negligence and acquitted him of manslaughter by failing to provide the necessaries of life. J.F. appealed his conviction.  [58]The Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial ((2007), 226 O.A.C. 119, 2007 ONCA 500).  MacFarland J.A., writing for the majority, held that the two verdicts were inconsistent and irreconcilable. Lang J.A., in dissent, found the verdicts to be consistent in light of the qualitative differences between the two offences and the trial judge’s instructions to the jury. The Crown appeals to this Court on the basis that the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law by concluding that the verdicts were inconsistent. J.F. cross-appeals and argues that an acquittal ought to have been entered instead of a new trial being ordered. ",

            "[3]     The “worst offender, worst offence” principle invoked by the appellant in the Court of Appeal has been laid to rest.  It no longer operates as a constraint on the imposition of a maximum sentence where a maximum sentence is otherwise appropriate, bearing in mind the principles of sentencing set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 : R. v. Cheddesingh, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 433, 2004 SCC 16;  R. v. L.M., [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, 2008 SCC 31.  Unwarranted resort to maximum sentences is adequately precluded by a proper application of those principles, notably the fundamental principle of proportionality set out in s. 718.1 of the Code, and Parliament’s direction  in s. 718.2(d) and (e) to impose the least restrictive sanction appropriate in the circumstances: see R. v._Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.",
            "[8]     Read literally, the impugned passage is capable of this construction.  With respect, it is to that extent wrong in law.  Where the Crown elects to prosecute a hybrid offence summarily, as it did in this case, that offence must be treated for sentencing purposes as a summary conviction offence. The defendant is therefore liable, except where otherwise provided by law, to a fine of not more than $5,000 ($2,000 at the time of trial in this case) or to imprisonment for six months or to both: Criminal Code , s. 787(1) .  Accordingly, the appellant did indeed receive the maximum custodial sentence on the only count that remains in issue here — for failure to stop a motor vehicle while being pursued by the police — and the question is whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in affirming that sentence.",
            "[12] Moreover, through his counsel in this Court (who did not represent him at trial), the appellant does not now argue that his global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive.  He submits instead that the Court of Appeal, in considering the fitness of the six-month sentence that remains in issue, failed to give effect to the sentencing principles, notably the fundamental principle of proportionality, made applicable by Parliament in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  to indictable and summary conviction offences alike.  Section 718.1 of the Code provides:",
            "[16] In short, the sentencing principles set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code  apply to both indictable and summary conviction offences.  Parliament has made that clear in the definition of “court” at s. 716 of the Code.  And when the Crown elects to prosecute a “hybrid” offence by way of summary conviction, the sentencing court is bound by the Crown’s election to determine the appropriate punishment within the limits established by Parliament for that mode of procedure.  Absent an error of principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or overemphasis of the appropriate factors, any sentence within that range —  including the maximum — should not be varied on appeal unless it is demonstrably inadequate or excessive."

        "Facts": " [48]Indeed, the sentencing regime under Canadian law must be implemented within, and not apart from, the framework of theCharter.  Sentencing decisions are always subject to constitutional scrutiny.  A sentence cannot be “fit” if it does not respect the fundamental values enshrined in theCharter.  Thus, incidents alleged to constitute aCharterviolation can be considered in sentencing, provided that they bear the necessary connection to the sentencing exercise.  As mitigating factors, the circumstances of the breach would have to align with the circumstances of the offence or the offender, as required by s. 718.2 of theCode.  Naturally, the more egregious the breach, the more attention the court will likely pay to it in determining a fit sentence.  [49]This is consistent with the communicative function of sentencing. A proportionate sentence is one that expresses, to some extent, society’s legitimate shared values and concerns.  As Lamer C.J. stated inM. (C.A.):  Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by theCriminal Code. [para. 81]  A sentence that takes account of aCharterviolation is therefore able to communicate respect for the shared set of values expressed in theCharter.  In the words of Professor Allan Manson:  The communicative function of sentencing is all about conveying messages.  The messages are directed to the community.  They are about the values which ought to be important to the community. (“CharterViolations in Mitigation of Sentence” (1995), 41 C.R. (4th) 318, at p. 323)  Indeed,s. 718of theCriminal Codedescribes the fundamental purpose of sentencing as that of contributing to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society”.  This function must be understood as providing scope for sentencing judges to consider not only the actions of the offender, but also those of state actors.  Provided that the impugned conduct relates to the individual offender and the circumstances of his or her offence, the sentencing process includes consideration of society’s collective interest in ensuring that law enforcement agents respect the rule of law and the shared values of our society.  [50]The conclusion that the circumstances of allegedCharterbreaches can be considered during sentencing, when they are relevant to the offender and to the offence, is consistent with much of the sentencing jurisprudence.  In several cases, courts have reduced a sentence to reflect the prejudice caused to the accused by the incident giving rise to aCharterviolation, without invoking s. 24(1).  For instance, inR. v. Munoz, 2006 ABQB 901, 69 Alta. L.R. (4th) 231, an offender’s overall sentence was reduced to take account of the breach of his s. 7 and s. 12 rights by police guards.  While awaiting trial for serious offences including robbery and aggravated assault, the accused was subject to acts of physical violence by the guards and was forced to wear a degrading prisoner uniform called a “baby doll”.  Writing for the court, Wilkins J. described the accused’s treatment at the hands of the police as “grossly disproportionate to the punishment that was appropriate” (para. 77).  He held that a fit sentence, notwithstanding theCharterbreaches, would have been seven years’ imprisonment, on the high end of the scale for those particular offences.  Taking the breaches into account, and after ordering an enhanced credit of 33 months for time served in the remand facility, he ordered a sentence of two years less a day in jail.  The court did not cites. 24(1)of theCharteras authority for the sentence reduction.  [51]Perhaps more instructive to the current appeal isR. v. Pigeon(1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (B.C.C.A.), which illustrates the court’s authority to address police violence within the context of ordinary sentencing principles.  The offender was a Chilcotin man who had fled from police after committing a break and enter.  After an officer fired a shot into the air, Mr. Pigeon returned from whence he had fled — unarmed and unaggressive — with the intent to surrender.  The officer grabbed Mr. Pigeon by the hair and threw him onto the pavement.  Rather than handcuff the accused at this point, the officer lifted him back up and dragged him by the hair to where the other officer was stationed.  He threw him onto the ground again and, with the other officer’s foot firmly placed on the accused’s neck, handcuffed him.  Mr. Pigeon did not resist arrest or attempt to escape at any time.  [52]The accused was convicted and sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment followed by 18 months’ probation.  The trial judge acknowledged the injuries suffered by Mr. Pigeon during his arrest, but concluded that the officer’s use of force was irrelevant to the offender’s sentence:  Although you deserve some sympathy on account of that ill treatment, it is not a factor that I am prepared to take into consideration.  You have a civil remedy.  After releasing those reasons, the trial judge filed a formal report to the Court of Appeal recommending a reduced sentence of six months’ imprisonment.  He wrote: I refused to take into account the assaults that the accused had suffered at the hands of the police, and told him that he had a civil remedy for that.  On reflection I am of the view that effect ought to have been given to the assaults. Had I considered it appropriate to do so I would have further reduced the term of imprisonment by three months to six months.  . . .  I am respectfully of the view that it is not in the public interest that police constables should be perceived as “getting away” [with] ill treating aboriginal people, and I am no longer of the view that a civil remedy is the proper form of redress.  On appeal, Carrothers J.A. accepted the trial judge’s findings that the degree of force used by police was unwarranted and excessive.  He noted that, although the court is “not sitting in judgment of the police”, it is within the ambit of the appellate court’s review of the fitness of the sentence to consider all that is known about the offender and the offence, along with the “realities and complexion of the community . . . which are relevant to and bear upon the public perception of justice” (p. 343).  In light of these considerations, Carrothers J.A. ordered a reduced sentence of six months’ imprisonment, falling to the low end of the scale of sentences for similar offences.  [53]It is important to note that a sentence can be reduced in light of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the level of aCharterbreach.  InPigeon, the court did not need to determine whether the accused’s s. 7 rights had been violated, as there was sufficient scope within the regular sentencing process to address the impropriety of the police officers’ actions.  Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal held inR. v. Bosley(1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 347, that the trial judge had properly considered excessive but not unconstitutional delay as a mitigating factor in his determination of a fit sentence (see alsoR. v. Leaver(1996), 3 C.R. (5th) 138 (Ont. C.A.)).  And inR. v. Panousis, 2002 ABQB 1109, 329 A.R. 47, the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench treated the delay in the proceedings as a relevant mitigating factor that led to a reduced sentence for the offence of trafficking in cocaine.  Although the delay did not amount to a s. 11(b) violation, the court held that it had caused prejudice to the accused that was relevant and probative to the sentencing process.  The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, in brief oral reasons (2004 ABCA 211 (CanLII)), reversed the trial judge’s decision and imposed a sentence of incarceration of two years less a day and a heavy fine.  The majority did not state whether it disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that delay was a relevant mitigating circumstance, but it is notable that its final sentence went below the trial judge’s appreciation of the usual sentences for serious drug offences.  [54]To be certain, the concept of recognizing harm or prejudice caused to the offender as a mitigating circumstance upon sentencing did not originate with theCharter.  In the pre-Chartercase ofR. v. Kirzner(1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 665, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence for drug offences to reflect the police force’s role in exposing the offender to the opportunity to commit the offences for which he was convicted.  The RCMP had used the offender, who was addicted to heroin, as an informer to infiltrate and gain information about the drug trade in Montreal.  The court found that, although the defence of entrapment was not available to the accused, the police were sufficiently implicated in the offender’s actions to warrant a reduction of his sentence.  Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence in the pre-Chartercontext to mitigate the effects of an unlawful search of the accused’s premises inR. v. Steinberg, [1967] 1 O.R. 733.  Excessive delay attributable to the prosecution or police has also been considered a mitigating factor in a number of pre-Chartercases (R. v. Cooper (No. 2)(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Simon(1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 159 (Ont. C.A.)).  Likewise, delay arising out of strategically delayed charges in respect of contemporaneous offences has led to reduction of the sentences (R. v. Parisien(1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (B.C.C.A.);R. v. Burke, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Fairn(1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 423 (N.S. Co. Ct.)).  [55]Thus, a sentencing judge may take into account police violence or other state misconduct while crafting a fit and proportionate sentence, without requiring the offender to prove that the incidents complained of amount to aCharterbreach.  Provided the interests at stake can properly be considered by the court while acting within the sentencing regime in theCriminal Code, there is simply no need to turn to theCharterfor a remedy.  However, if aCharterbreach has already been alleged and established, a trial judge should not be prevented from reducing the sentence accordingly, so long as the incidents giving rise to the breach are relevant to the usual sentencing regime.  Of course, as we shall see, as a general rule, a court cannot reduce a sentence below a mandatory minimum or order a reduced sentence that is not provided for by statute.  That said, circumstances of aCharterbreach or other instances of state misconduct, in exceptional circumstances, do allow a court to derogate from the usual rules to which its decisions are subject.

        "Facts": " [8]The appellant Andrew McIntosh was employed by theNational Postfrom August 1998 until February 2005.  He took an interest in then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien’s involvement with the Grand-Mère Golf Club located in Mr. Chrétien’s home riding of St-Maurice, Quebec.  His investigation led him to suspect Mr. Chrétien’s involvement with a 1997 loan from the BDBC to the Auberge Grand-Mère, a hotel located next to the golf club, and with other federal grants in the riding.  During his investigations, Mr. McIntosh contacted a person known to us only as X, but at that time X was unwilling to talk to Mr. McIntosh, even on a confidential basis.  A.The Secret Source  [9]However, in the Fall of 2000, another individual known only as Y contacted Mr. McIntosh and indicated that he or she had important information but would only disclose it in return for a promise of confidentiality.  Mr. McIntosh was generally authorized by the then editor-in-chief of theNational Postto give promises of confidentiality and he routinely did so.  The editor-in-chief testified that he considers himself a party to such promises of confidentiality.  Indeed, the reviewing judge found that “[a]ll of Mr. McIntosh’s work was done with the support of the then Editor-in-Chief” (para. 8).  [10]Mr. McIntosh testified that “[t]he condition I agreed to in order to gain access to these materials was that I would . . . give a blanket, unconditional promise of confidentiality to protect the identity of both X and Y” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 156).  [11]Y told Mr. McIntosh that he was acting on X’s behalf and explained that X was willing to provide McIntosh with documents and information concerning the Auberge Grand-Mère loan.  Based on materials received from Y, including what appeared to be copies of original documents from BDBC files and information received from other sources, Mr. McIntosh reported in theNational Postthat Mr. Chrétien had called the president of the BDBC and urged approval of the bank loan to Auberge Grand-Mère.  When asked by reporters to comment, Mr. Chrétien acknowledged that the story was accurate.  Numerous articles followed.  B.The Plain Brown Envelope  [12]On April 5, 2001, Mr. McIntosh received a sealed plain brown envelope at the Ottawa Bureau of theNational Post.  The envelope contained a document that appeared to be a copy of a BDBC internal loan authorization for a $615,000 mortgage to Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime Inc. (Auberge Grand‑Mère) in August 1997.  On the face of it, the document purported to show that, at the time it applied for and received the loan, Auberge Grand‑Mère listed an outstanding debt of $23,040 to “JAC Consultants”,  a Chrétien family investment company.  Mr. McIntosh concluded that if the document were genuine, it would represent a major escalation in the Shawinigate story.  [13]To check the authenticity of the document, Mr. McIntosh faxed copies to the BDBC, the Prime Minister’s office, and to a lawyer for the Prime Minister.  All three said that the document was a forgery.  The BDBC sent two letters to theNational Poston April 6, 2001.  The first claimed that the BDBC’s records showed no indication of a debt owed to JAC Consultants.  In the second letter, the BDBC warned theNational Postthat bank documents were confidential and should not be disclosed.  A short time after receiving these letters, Mr. McIntosh put the document and its envelope somewhere, he claims, only he is able to access them.  [14]The Bloc Quebecois also received a copy of the BDBC “document” which it photocopied and distributed to its members and others.  The story was picked up by some news sources.  The police believe, however, that only theNational Posthas an envelope and document that could disclose fingerprint or DNA evidence that might in turn lead to identification of the perpetrator(s) and provide physical evidence of the alleged crime(s).  [15]Since it was unable to confirm the document’s authenticity, theNational Posthesitated to publish the allegations.  However, other news organizations published details about the leaked document and the reference to the alleged $23,040 loan and eventually theNational Postpicked up the story and reported that theGlobe and Mail, SunMedia and CTV had already published some details of the alleged bank document, as had theOttawa Citizen.  C.The Modified Undertaking of Confidentiality  [16]Sometime during the week after the receipt of the document, X sought a meeting with Mr. McIntosh, who then consulted legal counsel and editors.  X confirmed that it was he or she who had sent the envelope and asked that it be destroyed.  X expressed concern that the police might try to use it to identify him or her through fingerprint or DNA analysis, and feared that the envelope might link him or her to the bank document now alleged to be a forgery.  Mr. McIntosh testified that he told X “that I would not dispose of them.  I said this would be both improper and highly unethical given the serious allegation that the document had been forged” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 225).  [17]However, as stated earlier, Mr. McIntosh also told X that so long as “I  believed that [X] had not provided the document to deliberately mislead me, my undertaking of confidentiality would remain binding.  I also told Confidential Source X that should irrefutable evidence to the contrary emerge, our agreement of confidentiality would become null and void.  X agreed to these terms” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 227).  [18]Mr. McIntosh testified that X explained that he or she had received the document in the mail anonymously and had passed it on to Mr. McIntosh in the belief that it was genuine.  On at least one other occasion, Mr. McIntosh had been able to confirm the authenticity of documents that X claimed to have received in the same way.  In his evidence, Mr. McIntosh said he was satisfied that X was a reliable source and that the loan authorization was genuine.  If the loan authorization was a forgery, Mr. McIntosh did not believe X knew that.  D.The Police Investigation  [19]In the meantime, the BDBC had complained to the RCMP about the alleged forgery.  On June 7, 2001, RCMP Corporal Roland Gallant met with Mr. McIntosh, his editor-in-chief, another editor of theNational Post, and its legal counsel.  Counsel for theNational Postrefused Corporal Gallant’s request to produce the documents.  The police officer was told that before becoming aware of the police investigation, Mr. McIntosh had placed the document and envelope in a secure location not onNational Postpremises.  Mr. McIntosh declined to identify the secret source.  [20]Corporal Gallant indicated that he would have to apply for a search warrant and assistance order in relation to two offences — forgery (creation of a false document with the intent that it be acted upon as genuine) and uttering a forged document (attempting to cause Mr. McIntosh and theNational Postto act on the forged loan authorization as if it were genuine).  TheNational Postexpressed “grave concerns” about the constitutionality of a warrant to disclose a confidential source and requested aninter parteshearing on the warrant application.  E.The Search Warrant and Assistance Order  [21]On July 4, 2002, Corporal Gallant applied to the Ontario Court of Justice for a warrant assistance order stating that the evidence he wished to seize was not available from any other source because the document and envelope formed part of theactus reusof these offences and would be required to substantiate any charges.  He intended to submit the document and envelope for forensic testing to determine if they had “fingerprints or other identifying markings which might assist in identifying the source of the document”.  These other possible identifying markers included saliva, from which a DNA sample could be obtained.  [22]Khawly J. was advised of the desire of theNational Postfor notice and a hearing but decided to proceedex parte.  The search warrant and assistance order were issued without written reasons.  The intended effect of the assistance order was to require the editor-in-chief of theNational Postto assist in locating the two documents in question and to make them available to Corporal Gallant.  [23]In relation to procedural protection, the terms of the orders attempted to accommodate the special position of the media.  It was provided that the orders were to be served on July 5, 2002.  The appellants would thereafter be given  a month to consider their position.  On August 9, 2002 (or such earlier date as the appellants agreed to) Corporal Gallant was again to attend at the offices of theNational Postand request production of the BDBC loan authorization and the “associated” brown envelope.  The warrant then provided that after waiting two hours (to give the appellants an opportunity for voluntary compliance without prejudice to any subsequent challenge they might see fit to make to the issuance or execution of the warrant) the police officer would then be free to search theNational Postpremises.  The police were directed to interfere “as little as possible with the operations of the place being searched and avoid, to the extent possible, examining any notes, documents, records or lists unconnected with securing the location of the things subject to seizure”.  If found, the documents would on request be marked for identification and sealed in a package and delivered for safekeeping to the Ontario Court of Justice.  The appellants would then have 14 days to apply “for the continued sealing and return of any things sealed”.  [24]The appellants duly applied to quash the warrant and assistance order.  Relying upon a considerably amplified record which included the cross-examination of Mr. McIntosh and the filing of 15 affidavits from experienced journalists on the use and importance of secret sources, Benotto J., the reviewing judge, concluded that while there was “sufficient information to conclude the document was a forgery” (para. 22), there was “only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints were those of the alleged forgerer” and “[d]isclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation while at the same time damage freedom of expression” (para. 79). Accordingly, she set aside the search warrant and assistance order.  Her decision was reversed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on February 29, 2008 in reasons jointly authored by Justices Laskin and Simmons (2008 ONCA 139, 89 O.R. (3d) 1).  References will be made in what follows to the reasons of the reviewing judge and the Court of Appeal. ",

            "[4]     In accordance with the procedure set out in the Act , the Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of the United States and the Minister of Justice, sought an order of committal from the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  In support of the application for committal, the Attorney General submitted a record of the case prepared by the requesting state.  As required under s. 33(1)  of the Act , the record of the case  contained “a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for use in the prosecution” and was duly certified.  The summary described evidence gathered in both the United States and in Canada.  The evidence gathered in the United States consisted mainly of individual statements from 11 representative victims of the fraudulent telemarketing scheme, all of whom reside in the United States.  The evidence allegedly linking Mr. Anekwu to the scheme was located and gathered in Canada, in part under the authority of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 30 (4th Supp .).  The Canadian-gathered evidence included corporate records, mailbox records, bank records, police surveillance and an immigration photograph of Mr. Anekwu.  The records themselves were not filed, but their contents were described in the summary.  In addition to the record of the case, the Attorney General relied on the viva voce testimony of Corporal Peter Bailey of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in relation to his arrest of Mr. Anekwu in Canada."

        "Facts": " [80]Following the trial judge’s initial charge, the jury returned with the following question:  Can we please get a legal definition of reasonable doubt? What things can it be based upon, for example, feelings, intuitions, et cetera? If mostly based on circumstantial evidence, where do we draw the line? Please advise.  In his response to this specific question from the jury, the trial judge repeated three more times the incorrect component of this instruction, using the term “equally”.  Because the jury was likely to have paid particular attention to the answer to their question, this would have amplified the misdirection (seeR. v. Brydon, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 253, at para. 16). [81]Pursuant to an objection by defence counsel, the trial judge gave additional instructions, finally using the correct language.  However, he did not draw the jury’s attention to the repeated error in his previous instructions.  On the contrary, he reiterated a statement that he had made to the jury several times before, merely omitting, on this occasion, the incorrect term “equally”.  This could not possibly have dispelled the confusion.  [82]We agree with our colleague that jury instructions should be read as a whole. However, this reading must include the correctand the incorrectdirections.  The defective statements are not eclipsed by a correct statement of the law elsewhere in the charge.  If an incorrect instruction has been given, the trial judge must advert to it and correct it clearly.  Otherwise, the unidentified incorrect statements may linger in the juror’s minds, creating confusion as to the state of the law and obliging the jury to decide on their own which of the competing expositions of the law to apply to the facts.  In this sense, the jurors would be left toinstruct themselvesas to the law they were required to apply in reaching their verdict.  [83]In order to ensure that a misdirection to the jury has been successfully rectified, a trial judge will generally have to repeat the direction he or she has given, acknowledge that it was incorrect, tell the jury to put it out of their minds and then tell them in plain and simple terms what the law is:R. v.

        "Facts": " [4]The trial testimony revealed that, in the hours before the shooting on March 5, 2001, the appellant had had an argument with his common-law partner, Barbara Ettinger.  Ms. Ettinger had tried to end their relationship, asking him to move out of her apartment, but he refused to leave and instead made an attempt at reconciliation.  Eventually they went to bed, at which point the appellant tried to become intimate and to remove Ms. Ettinger’s clothing.  She resisted, and called out to the neighbours through the bedroom wall to get them to call the police.  The appellant brought her the phone himself so she could make the call.  [5]According to the transcript of her conversation with the RCMP dispatcher, Ms. Ettinger suggested that the argument could become “physical”, and she told the dispatcher that the appellant had said he was prepared to put up a fight when the police arrived.  Once the call had ended, the appellant removed a shotgun from the closet — he claimed that he felt this would make her stop arguing — and pumped it to show that it was loaded.  This caused a live round to eject, which he placed back in the gun before returning it to the closet. The appellant then had a cigarette and coffee while waiting for the police to arrive.  Ms. Ettinger testified that the appellant double-checked the gun in the closet when Cst. Seewald knocked on the door, and put it back when Ms. Ettinger admonished him to do so.  The appellant denied having done this.  [6]When Cst. Seewald arrived, Ms. Ettinger answered the door and informed him that the appellant had a gun before letting him into the apartment.  The officer assured her that everything would be fine and entered the apartment.  Ms. Ettinger testified that no guns were visible in the apartment at that time.  Once inside, the officer asked the appellant to sit down in the living room.  According to the appellant, he refused to sit down and Cst. Seewald then pushed him into a chair, ripping his T-shirt in the process.  Ms. Ettinger left the room to get him a new shirt.  In her absence, the appellant claimed, he stood up from the chair and the officer started to pepper-spray him, causing intense pain and a burning sensation in his eyes.  Ms. Ettinger did not hear or see anything while she was getting the shirt, but she testified that when she returned to the living room, the appellant was trying to shield his eyes from the pepper spray, exclaiming that it hurt.  [7]Ms. Ettinger then recalled seeing the appellant and Cst. Seewald struggling with each other in the living room and moving out onto the porch, where the struggle continued.  She did not see either of them pick up the shotgun, but first noticed  it when the two men were outside on the porch.  She testified that they both had their hands on the weapon, and that Cst. Seewald had said something like “Give me the gun”, while pushing down on the barrel.  Finally, she heard a shot and saw a bright flash.  Constable Seewald exclaimed “I’m shot” and fell to the ground.  A neighbour testified that she heard Ms. Ettinger cry out “No, don’t” before the shot was fired.  Ms. Ettinger recalled screaming after the officer was shot, and described a look of disbelief on the appellant’s face.  [8]At trial, to counter the appellant’s claim that the shot was fired accidentally in a struggle over the gun, the Crown led expert evidence on the likely distance from which the shot was fired.  According to Dr. Bannach, a forensic pathologist, the scalloped edges of the wound were consistent with a shot fired from a distance of at least three feet, while the existence of satellite wounds and the presence of plastic wads extended the likely distance to between four and eight feet.  Mr. Voth, an RCMP forensic firearms expert, offered a similar estimate that the shot was fired at a distance of between two and five feet; his estimate was based on his analysis of gunshot residue on Cst. Seewald’s parka and on a parka similar in make and style to the one worn by the officer on the night of the shooting.  Mr. Voth also testified that the gun could not have discharged accidentally or as a result of being dropped or struck.  Defence counsel objected to Mr. Voth’s conclusions on the basis of how the parka had been transported from the scene of the shooting and of the order in which he had conducted the chemical tests, which, Mr. Voth admitted, may have had an impact on his ability to form a conclusive opinion of the results.  [9]The appellant claimed to have no memory of the events after he was pepper-sprayed until he found himself on the porch and heard Ms. Ettinger yelling.  He testified that when he realized he had shot the officer, he reloaded the gun to kill himself.  Ms. Ettinger intervened and stopped him from doing so.  The appellant then walked out onto the sea ice with his gun, still contemplating suicide.  [10]Constable Seewald died from his wounds shortly after emergency workers arrived on the scene. Later that day, the appellant turned himself in to the police and was charged with first degree murder contrary tos. 235(1)of theCriminal Code. ",

        "Facts": " [45]First, it is necessary to excise several misleading passages in the ITO that suggested Mr. Hounjet had actually viewed illegal pornography on the computer, rather than suspiciously labelled bookmarks (“Favourites”).  In particular, para. 5 of the ITO, the first to adduce specific facts in support of the application, contains two glaring and misleading inaccuracies.  It states, first, that “[o]nce on the computer HOUNJET observed ‘Lolita Porn’ on the screen”, and then that Mr. Hounjet “returned the next day to find the porn removed”.  [46]The clear implication of these assertions is that Mr. Hounjet in fact saw “Lolita Porn” (pornography involving young girls) on the screen and that he determined that this pornography was subsequently removed from the computer.  But Mr. Hounjet saw nothing of the sort.  As is clear from thevoir dire, all he saw were two links labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX” in the “Favourites” menu of the Internet browser.  “Favourites” or bookmarks are nothing more than “menu entries” that serve as shortcuts that provide easy access to an Internet site.  [47]Justice Deschamps finds (at para. 155) that “[t]here could be no confusion about what was seen.”  I respectfully disagree.  Nowhere does the ITO disclaim the clear statement in para. 5 that Mr. Hounjet saw “Lolita Porn” and that “the porn” was subsequently removed.  While para. 10 does specify that Mr. Hounjet saw “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX”icons, the last sentence of that very paragraph perpetuates the impression thatactualchild pornography (rather than links) was seen: It asserts that when Mr. Hounjet arrived the next day “all the child porn off the computer was gone”. [48]There is no reasonable basis for assuming that the justice of the peace would have understood these clear and misleading statements to refer exclusively to the icons mentioned in para. 10.  The natural reading of the ITO is that pornographic images of children were actually seen on the computer.  This is an entirely false claim, and these statements must therefore be excised from the ITO.  [49]Aside from false statements, the ITO in several places gave an incomplete and misleading account of the facts, in contravention of the informant’s duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material information.  [50]For example, thevoir direrevealed that the two bookmarks described in the ITO — the bookmarks labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX” — were “just scattered through the favourites” among additional links pointing to “regular adult material” (Testimony of Adrian Hounjet at thevoir dire, A.R., at pp. 98-100).  This is not mentioned at all in the ITO.  [51]Moreover, the only pornographic image that Mr. Hounjet actually did see — an image on the accused’s computer desktop or Internet homepage — was perfectly legal adult pornography.  The failure to mention these facts creates a misleading impression that the accused was particularly inclined towards child pornography or exclusively seeking it out.  [52]Once it is clearly understood that the suspicious “Favourites” were in fact anomalies or exceptions, found together with much more material that was undisputedly legal, the inference that the accused possessed illegal images — or that evidence of criminal possession would be found upon a search of the computer — becomes significantly less compelling.  [53]Similarly, the ITO placed great emphasis on the presence of a “web-cam pointing towards [children’s] toys”, and noted also that “[t]he client was alone in the house  with a three year old child” (ITO, at para. 5).  Indeed, these statements appear in the very first substantive paragraph of the ITO.  Later in the ITO, one learns that the webcam was not hooked up to the computer but was rather plugged into a VCR that recorded to videotape (para. 10).  [54]The descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed immediately alongside the descriptions of the suspicious “Favourites” and the claims that Mr. Hounjet had “observed ‘Lolita Porn’”.  The ITO thus invited the justice of the peace to make an unwarranted connection between the two “Lolita” bookmarks and the webcam trained at the children’s play area.  Read as a whole, the ITO could thus be understood to allege that the accused had made and possessed his own illegal pornography, in addition to possessing images from the Internet on his computer.  [55]The informant’s narrative would have appeared much less sinister — and much less supportive of the claim that the accused possessed child pornography — had the ITO included a number of additional facts known to the police.  [56]First, the three-year old child mentioned (but not identified) in the ITO was in fact the accused’s daughter.  Second, the ITO stated that the accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to mention that his wife lived with them.  Third, the ITO failed to mention that the child was fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the computer room had a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the child, and that the child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of the room when Mr. Hounjet arrived, before being taken out of the room by the accused (A.R., at pp. 206-10).  [57]These omitted facts all tend to undermine suspicions about the accused.  Once they are added to the picture, it seems much more plausible that the accused was simply using the VCR and webcam to videotape his young daughter at play for posterity’s sake, rather than for any purpose connected to child pornography.  [58]In failing to provide these details, the informant failed to respect his obligation as a police officer to make full and frank disclosure to the justice.  When seeking anex parteauthorization such as a search warrant, a police officer — indeed, any informant — must be particularly careful not to “pick and choose” among the relevant facts in order to achieve the desired outcome. The informant’s obligation is to presentallmaterial facts, favourable or not.  Concision, a laudable objective, may be achieved by omitting irrelevant or insignificant details, but not by material non-disclosure.  This means that an attesting officer must avoid incomplete recitations of known facts, taking care not to invite an inference that would not be drawn or a conclusion that would not be reached if the omitted facts were disclosed.  [59]The relevant question here is whether the ITO was misleading, not whether it wasintentionallymisleading.  Indeed, in the Court of Queen’s Bench, the judge who had the benefit of observing the Crown’s witnesses on thevoir direfound no deliberate attempt to mislead.  That conclusion should not be disturbed.  It is nonetheless evident that the police officer’s selective presentation of the facts painted a less objective and more villainous picture than the picture that would have emerged had he disclosed all the material information available to him at the time.  [60]The facts originally omitted must be considered on a review of the sufficiency of the warrant application.  InAraujo, the Court held that where the police make good faith errors in the drafting of an ITO, the warrant authorization should be reviewed in light of amplification evidence adduced at thevoir direto correct those mistakes.  Likewise, where, as in this case, the police fail to discharge their duty to fully and frankly disclose material facts, evidence adduced at thevoir direshould be used to fill the gaps in the original ITO.  V  [61]The admissibility of the evidence obtained pursuant to the search and seizure of the appellant’s computer depends on two constitutional considerations.  The first is whether the search and seizure were unreasonable, within the meaning ofs. 8of theCharter; the second is whether admission of the evidence thereby obtained would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and should therefore be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2).  [62]The second question is only reached, of course, if the first is resolved in the appellant’s favour.  And that depends on whether the ITO, stripped of its erroneous and tendentious assertions, and amplified as indicated, provides sufficient credible and reliable evidence to have permitted the justice of the peace to find reasonable and probable grounds to believe both that the appellant was in culpable possession of child pornography and that evidence of that crime would be found in his computer.  [63]Essentially, only two inferential paths could have led the justice to conclude that the warrant should issue: (1) the two suspicious bookmarks; (2) the claims about the propensity of certain “types of offenders” to hoard images, combined with reason to believe that the accused is of that “type”.  In my view, both paths lead instead to an evidentiary dead end: they culminate in suspicion and conjecture, never reaching the mandatory threshold of reasonable and probable grounds to believe.  [64]The presence of the two “Lolita” links in the Favourites certainly supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a Web site that contained explicit images of females under the age of 18.  And it is not unreasonable to infer from the mere presence of the links on the appellant’s computer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they were knowingly added by him.  [65]This does not suffice, however, to establish possession.  First, as earlier explained, merely browsing a Web site or viewing images onscreen does not constitute  possession.  Neither does creating a bookmark on one’s computer establish possession over the content of the Web site: bookmarks merely provide quick and easyaccessto  the indicated Web sites.  Indeed, clicking on a bookmark may simply disclose that material previously on the Web site has been removed; that material previously absent has been added; that the Web site address is no longer valid — or that the Web site no longer exists at all.  [66]Accordingly, in order to commit the offence of possession (as opposed to the offence of accessing), one mustknowingly acquire the underlying data files and store them in a place under one’s control.  The presence of the icons might arouse suspicions regarding possession, but it does not alone support a reasonable inference that the appellant not only accessed the Web site and knowingly viewed illegal images located there, but also took the underlying data file into his control by saving it to the hard drive, or otherwise.  [67]Even if one takes the broader view that possession is complete on merely viewing images on-screen, other facts in the ITO preclude the possibility of inferring from the icons alone that evidence of the crime would be found in the appellant’s computer.  [68]Specifically, the ITO states that on the day after the icons were viewed, the computer’s hard drive was “formatted”.  On thevoir dire, it was confirmed that this meant that the entire contents of the hard drive were deleted.  Not only would the suspicious links have thus been erased, but illegal image files in the computer and any files evidencing past access to Web sites containing illegal images (such as browser histories or cache files) would also have been removed.  Normally, moreover, the greater the lapse of time after a hard drive has been formatted, the more likely it will be impossible to recover the former contents of the drive using forensic tools.  In this case, four months had passed.  And, in any event, the nature of “formatting” and data retention on computer drives was not sufficiently described in the ITO to permit issuance of the warrant on these grounds.  [69]To conclude that evidence of possession would be found four months after the hard drive was erased, one must therefore accept either that the accused had made external copies of illegal images present in the computer before formatting its hard drive or that he acquired additional illegal images after the formatting.  [70]Both possibilities require drawing inferences based on the likely behaviour of the accused.  The ITO seeks to establish the necessary inference on the basis of unsupported generalizations about the propensities of certain “types of offenders” to hoard and copy illegal images.  The ITO suggests that the accused is a person of that “type” and that, as a result, copies of the images would remain on the computer.  [71]In my view, the ITO does not establish either the veracity of the generalization about the alleged “type of offender”, nor that the accused is in fact the “type” to which the generalization might have applied.  [72]More specifically, the ITO makes two statements about the “propensities” of offenders.  It first states that “these type[s] of offenders are habitual and will continue their computer practices with child pornography” (ITO, at para. 12).  This claim is attributed to Corporal Boyce of the RCMP Technological Crime Unit.  The ITO also claims that “offenders treasure collections on their computer and like to store them and create backup’s [sic] in case they loose [sic] it.  Discs and floppy disks are used for this purpose.  Offenders will typically sort information and store pictures on different file names to catagorize [sic] them.” (ITO, at para. 13).  This statement is attributed to Constable Huisman of the Saskatoon Police Service Vice Unit.  [73]The main difficulty with these generalizations about certain “types of offenders” is that they are entirely devoid of meaningful factual support.  The ITO contains no evidentiary material in this regard, even anecdotal, apart from the bald assertion of the two police officers.  Furthermore, there is virtually nothing to describe, let alone establish, the expertise of the officers to whom the claims are attributed.  The only information provided in the ITO consists in the officers’ names, positions, and places of work.  This is surely an insufficient evidentiary basis to enable a justice of the peace, hearing an applicationex parte, to determine that the generalization is sufficiently credible or reliable to form the basis for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds.  [74]The amplification evidence presented on thevoir direis of little assistance to the Crown.  The failure to provide evidence of the officers’ expertise does not seem to be a mere “minor, technical error” that, in light ofAraujo, could be corrected with evidence adduced at thevoir dire.  In any event, it appears from this evidence that Cst. Ochitwa, the officer who prepared the ITO, believed Cst. Huisman to be an expert in crimes involving child pornography only on the basis of a recommendation from a prosecutor, his own impressions from talking to Cst. Huisman, and his understanding that Cst. Huisman had previously worked on unspecified “child exploitation offences”.  Cst. Ochitwa’s testimony does not mention any knowledge of the relevant experience that Cst. Huisman may have had or the basis for his opinions about the proclivities of child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 158-59 and 192-94).  [75]The evidence presented at thevoir direwith respect to Cpl. Boyce’s statements is more problematic still.  Cst. Ochitwa testified that he approached Cpl. Boyce in order to obtain information about “how computers operate” because “[Cpl. Boyce] was involved with the term [sic] technological crime”.  Cpl. Boyce thus appears to have been sought out as an expert oncomputer technology, not the habits of child pornography offenders.  While Cst. Ochitwa was aware that Cpl. Boyce worked in the Technological Crime Unit and knew what his duties were there — investigating crimes involving computers — there is no indication at all whether or how his work in that unit formed the basis for his opinions about child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 157-58 and 191-92).  [76]Perhaps even more troubling than the paucity of information as to the basis for the officers’ opinions is the fact that the class of persons to whom specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear no real significance.  Both officers speak about the propensities of undefined “types of offenders” or simply “offenders”.  [77]While it is clear from the context that the officers are referring to some variety of child pornography offenders, it cannot be assumed, without evidence, that broad but meaningful generalizations can be made about all persons who commit (or are suspected of committing) child pornography offences.  For example, a person with an exclusive interest in child pornography is surely of a different “type” than a person who is primarily or exclusively interested in legal adult images, but has nevertheless downloaded a small number of illegal images.  Similarly, a person who seeks out pornographic images of young children or infants is likely a different “type” than a person who views images of teenagers under the age of 18.  [78]These people all commit child pornography offences, but the “propensities” of one type may well differ widely from the “propensities” of others.  There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the information in the ITO, thatallchild pornography offenders engage in hoarding, storing, sorting, and categorizing activity.  And there is nothing in the ITO that indicates which specific subset of these offenders does generally engage in those activities.  [79]To permit reliance on broad generalizations about loosely defined classes of people is to invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu of evidence.  I am thus unable to agree with Justice Deschamps (at para. 162) that the ITO’s claims in this regard could properly be relied on by the justice.  [80]Justice Deschamps supports her reliance on claims about the behaviour of “types of offenders” by citing child pornography cases in which courts, in her view, have accepted the tendency of certain kinds of child pornography offenders to collect many images and store them over long periods of time (para. 162).  These decisions are rather in favour of  the conclusion that an evidentiary basis is required to support a finding as to the characteristics or propensities of child pornography offenders.  [81]That some child pornography offenders do seek out and hoard illegal images is, of course, neither surprising nor helpful in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds exist in a particular case.  Still, it is not the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations regarding the “proclivities” of certain “types” of people, including offenders.  Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown, according to the relevant standard — in this case, reasonable and probable grounds for belief.  As suggested earlier, moreover, courts must be particularly wary of endorsing such generalizations when, as in this case, the crime alleged is the subject of intense emotional responses and widespread condemnation, and the temptation to rely on stereotype rather that evidence is therefore especially dangerous and strong.  [82]An evidentiary basis is required as well for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the alleged offender belongs to the class of child pornography offenders whose characteristics or propensities are mentioned in the ITO.  This view of the law was adopted inR. v. Fawthrop(2002), 161 O.A.C. 350, the only Canadian appellate decision cited by Justice Deschamps.  My colleague finds in that decision support for her suggestion that general opinions on the propensity of child pornography offenders to collect and hoard child pornography material can give rise to reasonable and probable grounds for issuing search warrants.  With respect, I readFawthropdifferently.  As noted earlier,Fawthropaffirms the need for evidence both as to characteristics of an identified class of child pornography offenders, and as to the offender’s membership in that class.  [83]As Borins J.A., speaking for the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, explained inFawthrop(at para. 42):  In my view, the trial judge’s finding, based on the testimony of Det. Const. Pulkki, that the police were engaged in a “fishing expedition” for items of child pornography leads to the conclusion that the breach of the appellant’ss. 8Charterrights was serious. It appears from the record that after she interviewed A.Y. and members of her family, Det. Const. Pulkki suspected that the appellant was a pedophile, which led her to further suspect that he might possess items of child pornography. To be fair to her, she realized that her suspicion was insufficient to enable her to obtain a warrant. She was aware that it was necessary that she have reasonable grounds to believe that child pornography would be located in the appellant’s home. She sought the opinion of Dr. Collins in the hope that it would tip the scales from suspicion to reasonable grounds. As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion. Although Dr. Collins opined that it was not uncommon for pedophiles to collect items of child pornography, he was unable to form an opinion as to whether the appellant was a pedophile. Without that link, Det. Const. Pulkki was in the same position as she had been before she contacted Dr. Collins. All she had was a suspicion that the appellant might be in possession of child pornography. . . . This resulted in an unauthorized search for those items by means of what the trial judge correctly labelled a “fishing expedition”. This is what the search warrant process is meant to prevent.  In the result, the evidence seized under the warrant was excluded pursuant tos. 24(2)of theCharter.  [84]In short, in most of the cases cited by my colleague, the original warrant application included relatively detailed descriptions of the habits of a specific class of child pornography offender.  They thus provided evidence sufficient to establish a credible profile of a class of child pornography collectors and their typical behaviours, and a proper factual foundation for concluding that the alleged offender belonged to that class.  This is not our case.  [85]Here, even if the impugned generalizations are accepted, the ITO as amplified does not reasonably permit the inference that the accused was the “type of offender” who sought out illegal pornography and stored it.  This requirement was well explained inUnited States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 1345: “[I]f the government presents expert opinion about the behavior of a particular class of persons, for the opinion to have any relevance, the affidavit must lay a foundation which shows that the person subject to the search is a member of the class.”  [86]Two suspiciously labelled links in the “Favourites” menu do not suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.  Indeed, the fact that the bulk of the pornographic material that Mr. Hounjet observed at the accused’s house was perfectly legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not have a “pronounced” interest in child pornography at all, contrary to my colleague’s assertion (paras. 177 and 179).  [87]Also, and again with respect, the cases my colleague relies on (at para. 173) do not support the notion that a warrant can be issued months after a person might have merely viewed child pornography.  For example, inUnited States v. Terry, 522 F.3d 645 (6th Cir. 2008), the warrant was issued on a probable cause finding that the accusedhad in fact saved child pornography on his computer five months earlier.  Also, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal inR. v. Graham, 2008 PESCAD 7, 277 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 103, neither upheld the warrant nor affirmed the trial judge’s finding as to the effect of the passage of time.  [88]More broadly, Justice Deschamps may be understood to permit reasonable and probable grounds for belief  to rest on evidence that has only a tenuous relation to the crime in question — possessing illegal child pornography.  [89]For example, my colleague is of the view that the presence of the webcam, which was functioning effectively as a camcorder recording to a VCR, “showed that [the accused] was interested in reproducing images, accumulating such material, and keeping it for his future use”, showed that the accused “was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography” (para. 179).  With respect, neither the legal nor the logical relevance of these considerations is apparent to me.  [90]While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording videotapes and storing the tapes for future use — as is nearly everyone who owns a camcorder — this says absolutely nothing about his propensity to store a completely different kind of image (child pornography), in a completely different medium (a computer, as opposed to videotape), acquired in a completely different manner (downloading, as opposed to filming).  [91]The mere fact that a person collects, reproduces, or storesanything— music files, letters, stamps, and so forth — hardly supports an inference that he or she is of the type to hoard illegal images.  To draw that inference here is to speculate impermissibly.  At its highest, the proposed inference might provoke suspicion in some.  And, as a matter of law, suspicion is no substitute for reasonable and probable grounds to believe either that the appellant committed the alleged offence or that evidence of the offence would be found in his computer.  [92]Nor do I consider that the accused’s conduct after the visit — tidying up the room and formatting the hard drive — supports the conclusion that the accused was the sort of person to seek out and hoard child pornography.  [93]Justice Deschamps contends that these actions were evidence of a “desire not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or his computer practices” and that the conduct created “a credibly based probability that the appellant was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography” (para. 179).  [94]In my view, there is an obvious and innocent explanation for this conduct that is at least as plausible: The accused might well have tidied up and formatted his computer simply to avoid further embarrassment from having an outsider see the disorderly state of his home and the evidence of his consumption of pornography on his computer.  Again, the accused’s conduct might raise suspicions, but it establishes nothing more.  [95]In short, as mentioned at the outset, the ITO in this case is reduced by scrutiny to two links in the browser’s list of “Favourites” — links that were known to have been erased four months earlier.  At best, this may be a ground for suspicion, but surely the deleted links afford no reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant was in possession of child pornography, and still less that evidence of that crime would be found upon a search of his computer.  [96]Once the material facts omitted from the ITO are taken into consideration, it is apparent that none of the other evidence in the ITO — principally the presence of the webcam and the claims about propensities of unspecified “types of offenders” — can elevate mere suspicion into sufficient grounds for a warrant.  [97]Because the warrant should not have issued, the subsequent search violateds. 8of theCharter.  VI  [98]To determine whether the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search should be excluded under s. 24(2), we are bound to apply the test recently set out inGrant, at para. 71:  [U]nder s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society’s confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of theCharter‑infringing state conduct (admission may send the message the justice system condones serious state misconduct), (2) the impact of the breach on theCharter‑protected interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights count for little), and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.  The court’s role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I shall consider these three factors in turn.  [99]First, theCharter‑infringing state conduct in this case was the search of the accused’s home and the seizure of his personal computer, his wife’s laptop computer, several videotapes, and other items.  The search and seizure were unwarranted, but not warrantless: they were conducted pursuant to a search warrant by officers who believed they were acting under lawful authority.  The executing officers did not wilfully or even negligently breach theCharter.  These considerations favour admission of the evidence. To that extent, the search and seizure cannot be characterized as particularly egregious.  [100]The opposite is true on considering the ITO upon which the warrant was obtained.  The officer whopreparedthe ITO was neither reasonably diligent nor mindful of  his duty to make full and frank disclosure.  At best, the ITO was improvidently and carelessly drafted.  Not only did the ITO fail to specify the correct offence (accessing*rather than possession of child pornography); it was also drafted in a misleading way, resulting in the issuance of a warrant on insufficient grounds.  While the trial judge found no deliberate attempt to mislead, no attesting officer, acting reasonably, could have failed to appreciate that repeated references to “‘Lolita Porn’ on the screen” and to the deletion of “all the child porn off the computer” would cause most readers — and, more particularly, the issuing justice — to believe there was evidence that child pornography was actually viewed on-screen by the witness Hounjet. [101]Similarly, the officer should have known — if he in fact did not — that the immediate juxtaposition of these misleading statements and the incomplete description of the “web-cam pointing towards toys” would be unjustifiably inflammatory.  [102]The repute of the administration of justice is jeopardized by judicial indifference to unacceptable police conduct.  Police officers seeking search warrants are bound to act with diligence and integrity, taking care to discharge the special duties of candour and full disclosure that attach inex parteproceedings.  In discharging those duties responsibly, they must guard against making statements that are likely to mislead the justice of the peace.  They must refrain from concealing or omitting relevant facts. And they must take care not to otherwise exaggerate the information upon which they rely to establish reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of a search warrant.  [103]We are bound to accept the trial judge’s finding that there was no deliberate  misconduct on the part of the officer who swore the Information.  The repute of the administration of justice would nonetheless be significantly eroded, particularly in the long term, if such unacceptable police conduct were permitted to form the basis for so intrusive an invasion of privacy as the search of our homes and the seizure and scrutiny of our  personal computers.  [104]I turn in that light to the second factor set out inGrant: The impact of the breach on theCharter-protected interests of the accused.  The intrusiveness of the search is of particular importance in this regard.  Our concern here is with the search of the appellant’s home, in itself a serious breach of the appellant’s rights unders. 8of theCharter.  But there is more.  The infringement in this case involved a search of the appellant’s personal computer — and his wife’s laptop computer as well.  In passing, I  recall here the Informant’s failure to mention that the appellant lived with his wife.  This not only cast a dark light in the appellant’s presence alone with their child — perfectly understandable in the circumstances — but may also explain why the laptop, which was in fact not his, was seized and presumably scrutinized as well.  [105]As I mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one’s home and personal computer.  Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence.  They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations.  They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet.  [106]It is therefore difficult to conceive a s. 8 breach with a greater impact on theCharter-protected privacy interests of the accused than occurred in this case.  [107]I turn, finally, to the third factor to be weighed unders. 24(2)of theCharter— society’s interest in adjudication of the case on its merits.  Here, exclusion of the evidence obtained in the search would leave the prosecution with essentially no case against the accused.  It would thus seriously undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, a factor that weighs against exclusion (Grant, at paras. 79-83).  [108]In balancing these considerations, we are required byGrantto bear in mind the long-term and prospective repute of the administration of justice, focussing less on the particular case than on the impact over time of admitting the evidence obtained by infringement of the constitutionally protected rights of the accused.  [109]In my view, the repute of the administration of justice will be significantly undermined if criminal trials are permitted to proceed on the strength of evidence obtained from the most private “place” in the home on the basis of misleading, inaccurate, and incomplete Informations upon which a search warrant was issued.  [110]Justice is blind in the sense that it pays no heed to the social status or personal characteristics of the litigants.  But justice receives a black eye when it turns a blind eye to unconstitutional searches and seizures as a result of unacceptable police conduct or practices.  [111]The public must have confidence that invasions of privacy are justified, in advance, by a genuine showing of probable cause.  To admit the evidence in this case and similar cases in the future would undermine that confidence in the long term.  [112]I am persuaded for all of these reasons that admitting the illegally obtained evidence in this case would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  [113]I would therefore exclude that evidence and, since there was no possibility that the accused could have been convicted in the absence of the evidence, I would allow the appeal, quash the appellant’s conviction and enter an acquittal in its place.  The reasons of Deschamps, Charron and Rothstein JJ. were delivered by  [114]DeschampsJ. (dissenting) — Internet and computer technologies have brought about tremendous changes in our lives. They facilitate the communication of information and the exchange of material of all kinds and forms, with both legal and illegal content, and in infinite quantities.  No one can be unaware today that these technologies have accelerated the proliferation of child pornography because they make it easier to produce, distribute and access material in partial anonymity: Y. Akdeniz,Internet Child Pornography and the Law: National and International Responses(2008), at pp. 1-8. Not only do these technologies increase the availability of child pornography; they also raise new challenges, as  the criminal law must be adapted to apply to the making, distribution, and possession of such material, while the resulting offences must be investigated in a manner consistent with fundamental rights.  [115]The case at bar raises one such challenge. The appellant contends that the search of his computer breached his rights unders. 8of theCanadian Charterof Rights and Freedomsand that the evidence found on the computer should therefore be excluded and an acquittal entered on a charge of possession of child pornography (s. 163.1(4)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the reviewing judge did not err in upholding the decision to issue the warrant. Consequently, there is no need to addresss. 24(2)of theCharter. I would dismiss the appeal. ",

        "Facts": " [4]It is important to look at the facts about the search in issue here in the broader context of the investigation of which it formed a part. It is also important to remember that the decisions made by the police as to how to conduct the entry to the residence must be assessed in light of the information reasonably available to them at the time the decision was made. There is no question here that, had police known what they would in fact encounter in the residence, the approach would have been different.  However, as the trial judge wisely observed, “the [appellant] cannot attack the police decision on the basis of circumstances that were not reasonably known to the police”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 16.  [5]The police obtained three search warrants on the morning of November 30, 2005.  Two of the warrants related to dwelling houses and the third to a motor vehicle.  The appellant was not and never had been a target of the investigation.  Rather, the police were investigating what they believed to be “dial-a-dope” operation run by two members of a violent criminal gang.  Based on surveillance and other evidence, the police thought that the appellant’s residence was being used in that operation.  This investigation was not about someone like the appellant who was previously unknown to police and who was keeping a little cocaine in his bedroom. The police nonetheless were entitled to draw reasonable inferences about the risks the search of the Cornell residence posed to them and in relation to the destruction of evidence from the activities and people involved. As I shall outline in a moment, the police had good reasons to believe based, among other things, on their surveillance of the premises, that the Cornell residence, which the appellant had given as his address,  was being used in a drug dealing enterprise carried on by members of a violent criminal gang. They also had good reason to believe that the appellant himself was associated with at least one of these gang members who, through  police surveillance of the Cornell residence, appeared to be welcome there. Attempts to consider the appellant in isolation from these facts are, in my respectful view, highly artificial.  [6]In 2005, the Calgary police received information from a confidential informant that Henry Nguyen and Tuan Tran were running a “dial‑a‑dope” cocaine trafficking operation.   They were believed by police to be members of an organized criminal group known as the “Fresh Off the Boat” gang.  Police also believed that this gang, in the time leading up to the events in issue in this appeal, had been engaged in a violent war with another criminal gang that had resulted in a number of shootings and deaths. As one of the investigators said in his evidence at trial:  . . . it was a real concern for police officers having to attend any residence that may be frequented by persons from these groups, in that they could pose a real threat to the police. We would not want them to react to our presence, take hostages, to fight the police to try to gain their escape, to try to fend off the police while the evidence was destroyed.  So it became a very, very real security risk for the police officers that would be attending these residences.  [A.R., vol. II, at  p. 103]  The trial judge accepted this evidence.  [7]As mentioned, the police applied for, and obtained, search warrants for two residences which they believed were being used in the operation — the Tran residence and the Cornell residence — and, in addition, for a motor vehicle frequently used by Nguyen.  Detective Barrow of the Calgary Police Service swore an Information to Obtain A Search Warrant (“ITO”) relating to the Cornell residence that, among other things, included the following details:  ·An informant had told police that Nguyen and Tran ran a cocaine dial-a-dope operation (para. 11).  ·This information was substantiated by investigation which included surveillance of Tran and Nguyen, checks in various police and other databases and by the opinion of a police officer with long experience and expertise in the investigation of drug trafficking.  ·The activity at the two residences was consistent with them being used as  stash locations where Nguyen would reload his cocaine supply for the dial-a-dope business.  In particular, the ITO stated that Nguyen had made brief visits to the appellant’s residence on four occasions over a period of approximately two weeks. On the last visit, an unknown male accompanied Nguyen back to the vehicle for a short time and then returned to the residence.  ·The Cornell residence was owned by Phuong Kim Thi Le and was occupied by Lorraine Cornell.  ·Nguyen had been taken into custody two months before the search and released.  A mobile phone registered to the appellant as subscriber was found in the car Nguyen was driving at that time. The subscriber information for the telephone showed the appellant’s address as the Cornell residence. The appellant had also given the address of the Cornell residence when he had been involved in a car accident about five months earlier.  ·The tactical team would be required to enter the residence in order to avoid the destruction of evidence by potential occupants and for the safety of both the public and the police because of Nguyen and Tran’s history of violence and association with the organized crime group “Fresh Off the Boat”.  [8]A judge of the Alberta Provincial Court authorized warrants to search the Cornell residence as well as the other residence believed to be Tran’s and a motor vehicle operated by Nguyen.  The Cornell residence was placed under surveillance from the morning of November 30, 2005, until the search warrant was executed shortly before 6:00 that evening.  [9]The situation was complicated by the fact that the police felt that it was important to execute the three warrants as closely in time as possible.   As Constable Smolinski explained in his trial testimony, the police were concerned that if a person inside one residence was able to make a phone call, it might lead to loss of valuable evidence at the other. A tactical team was to be used at both residences and in the stop of the vehicle.  Its job was to secure the site and then turn it over to the investigators who would conduct the search.  [10]At the Cornell residence, the tactical team conducted an unannounced hard entry, sometimes referred to as a “dynamic entry”, by nine police officers with weapons drawn and wearing balaclavas and body armour. Entry involved battering the front door and entering the house while yelling “Police, search warrant”. The only person in the house at the time was the appellant’s brother, who was 29 years old and mentally challenged. He was taken down and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. His emotional distress became quickly apparent and the officer dealing with him removed the handcuffs, took off his balaclava, called the accompanying paramedic to assist and facilitated a call by the man to his mother Lorraine. According to the evidence, from the time of entry to the time that this individual was out of the handcuffs and seated on a couch being comforted by one of the officers was about four minutes: C.A., at para. 40,perSlatter J.A.  As noted by Slatter J.A. in the Court of Appeal, there was some damage to the premises during the entry, but Ms. Cornell testified that she was able to repair it with material she had around the house without incurring any expense: C.A., at para. 31.  [11]The tactical team did not have the warrant with  them when they entered the house. Detective Bent, who was in charge of the investigation and of the search that started as soon as the house was secured by the tactical team,  had a copy of the warrant.  He entered the residence approximately four minutes after the tactical team went in. The lone occupant present in the house at the time of entry did not ask to see the warrant and neither did Lorraine Cornell, although she was shown a copy when she came back to the house not long after Detective Bent’s arrival.  [12]The investigating officers discovered 99.4 grams of cocaine in the corner of the basement bedroom of Jason Cornell, in a box marked “Jason’s stuff”.   Mr. Cornell was later arrested at his place of employment.  He formally admitted that he possessed this cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.

        "Facts": " [27]The complainant, Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz, acknowledged that her complaint originated in a domestic dispute in which “there was a lot of emotion” (A.R., at p. 60).  [28]The military judge found that both the appellant and his wife “were attempting to give the court their best recollection of the events” and that “the discrepancies in the versions they g[a]ve are likely attributable to the heightened state of emotions on both sides that were in play on the morning of the 16 August” (2008 CM 2008 (CanLII), at para. 12).  He accepted the wife’s version of her fall but made no general finding of credibility in favour of Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz in preference to that of the appellant.  [29]There is no doubt that the appellant applied a measure of physical force to Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz without her consent but the question for the court under s. 39(1) was whether the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the degree of force exceeded what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances described by Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz herself as follows:  . . . we just continued to argue . . . .  He started to go up the stairs and I followed him up the stairs. . . . I was on the landing [where] you turn to the right and go up a next level . . . [a]nd we just continued to argue.  And then I looked to the right and Gary had a diploma from when he graduated from his leadership in training, his master’s.  And somehow – I don’t remember what I said, but I worked it into the conversation, and I took it off the wall and threw it on the ground. . . . [A.R., at pp. 60-61]  The military judge found that at that point the diploma was “perhaps jumped on” (para. 17).  [30]Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz acknowledged in cross-examination that she appreciated at the time that the diploma was of importance to the appellant:  Q. Okay.  When he went up the stairs, you followed him?  A. I did.  Q. Because you wanted to pursue the argument.  You were mad.  You had raised your voice at him.  He wanted to avoid and he went upstairs and you followed him and you kept arguing with him.  Isn’t that right?  A. That would be fair to say.  Yes.  Q. And then as he is upstairs, as you stated, or somewhat as you stated, you took the diploma.  A. Uh-huh.  Q. Would you say that this diploma was important to him?  A. I’m sure it had some value to him.  Yes.  Q. Yeah.  You took it, you looked at him, and you banged in on the floor. A. Uh-huh. [A.R., at p. 79]  Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz said that she was standing on “a little landing” (A.R., at p. 60) measuring about 3 feet by 3 feet (A.R., at pp. 81-82).  After she threw down the diploma, the appellant, she says, was upstairs and yelling and had “raised his fist” and Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz said to him, “‘Go ahead, hit me if you want to, Gary’.  And he just went, ‘Humph’” (A.R., at p. 61) and she then went to a framed picture (also hanging on the landing wall)  And I flicked the corner of it, and it fell down the stairs behind and smashed.  Like, the glass smashed and the frame broke, and then  i.e.afterMrs. Szczerbaniwicz had “flicked” down thesecondframed print  Gary came charging down the stairs at me and just – I don’t know how – I don’t know how, if he grabbed me or how he did it, but he basically turned me around and pushed me up the stairs . . . [A.R., at p. 61]  Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz acknowledged that her ongoing attack on his property “was intentional on [her] part” (A.R., at p. 81) and that when he came down the stairs, it seems, “[t]here wasn’t enough space” for both people on the landing (A.R., at p. 81).  [31]The military judge concluded from her evidence that she had suffered bruising on her back, legs and elbow but the fact that Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz had some bruises after falling on the staircase does not itself show that the force was excessive in the sense of disproportionate to what was “necessary”.  We were advised by counsel that some photographs were taken of Mrs. Szczerbaniwicz’s bruises.  The photographs were disclosed to the defence.  Neither the prosecution nor the defence put the photographs in evidence at trial or sought to do so on appeal.

            "[8]               Donald J.A., in dissent, would have granted a new trial on the ground that the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on the law of aiding and abetting and how it may apply to this case amounted to a miscarriage of justice to which the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , could not be applied.",
            "[10]             In my view, the majority was correct in finding that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned in this trial.  There is no question that the trial judge could have instructed the jury more fully on the different modes of participation that could ground criminal liability, including the law on aiding and abetting.  In hindsight and from a legalistic standpoint, it is easy to argue that he probably should have done so.  However, the adequacy of the jury instructions must be assessed in the context of the evidence and the trial as a whole.  There is nothing wrong, particularly in complex or lengthy trials, with the trial judge and counsel’s narrowing the issues for the jury by focussing on what is actually and realistically at issue in the case, provided that, at the end of the day, the jury is given the necessary instructions to arrive at a just and proper verdict.",
            "[13]             As outlined above, the central issue in this appeal is whether, in the context of the main charge and the trial as a whole, the trial judge’s response to the sole question posed by the jury effectively changed the “goal posts”, as Mr. Pickton’s counsel put it, thereby adversely impacting on the fairness of the trial.  A subsidiary issue arises whether the instructions as a whole, including the response to the jury question, adequately conveyed the law on the potential routes to criminal liability.",
            "The Defence responded to the Crown’s case by attempting to show that Pickton’s farm was a bee-hive of activity, that other persons, unknown and known (Dinah Taylor, Pat Casanova), used Pickton’s place to kill the women without Pickton being criminally involved.  Pickton did not testify but he called 31 witnesses.  The Defence argued that Pickton’s statements to the police did not amount to reliable admissions that he killed anyone.  Rather, Pickton scored low on verbal intelligence tests, was simply parroting back to the police accusations that were put to him in a 12 hour interrogation in an attempt to get the police off his property and lessen the impact of the investigation on those close to him.  The Defence submitted that his admissions to the cell plant reflected his unsophisticated efforts to impress his cell mate.  The Defence argued that Ellingsen and Bellwood, who were subject to a strong Vetrovec instruction, were chronic drug users, entrenched in a criminal life style, and that their testimony was implausible, unreliable, and unconfirmed by the rest of the evidence.  The Defence contended that the forensic evidence did not support the Crown’s theory.",
            "[18]             There is no question that the respective positions of the Crown and the defence permeate the entire record.  The Crown consistently maintained that one person committed all of the murders on the indictment and that that person was Mr. Pickton.  The defence maintained that he was not criminally involved.  The Crown’s sole perpetrator theory is perhaps understandable, given the cogency of the evidence pointing to Mr. Pickton at the centre of this inhuman scene.  It was also responsive to the tactic adopted by the defence to deflect any criminal responsibility from Mr. Pickton to other individuals.  However, the question that arises is whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Crown was bound to the theory that it advanced.",
            "[21]             Low J.A. held that “Ranger is distinguishable from the present case because, as I have attempted to demonstrate, the defence here knew that the co-principal theory of liability would be left with the jury” (para. 168).  I agree with Low J.A.’s assessment of the record and with his conclusion on this point.  The fallacy of Mr. Pickton’s argument lies in the fact that the defence theory itself put the participation of others at issue.  Throughout the trial, the defence by its approach urged the jury to consider that others may have actually killed the victims.  An inevitable consequence of going down that road is that the jury would have to be instructed on how this could, if at all, impact  on Mr. Pickton’s own criminal liability.  As Low J.A. aptly observed:",
            "The defence team was composed of experienced criminal defence counsel who could not have failed to be aware throughout of a co-party route to liability, as much as they might have wished to avoid it by confining the Crown to its sole-perpetrator theory.  Nor could they not have known of the legal duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury on any party route to liability that emerged from the evidence.  They could not have confined the court in the manner they hoped to confine the Crown.  An examination of the record makes this very apparent.  [para. 121]",
            "[23]             Accordingly, the trial judge did not confine his instructions to the Crown’s sole perpetrator theory, but explained to the jury what effect any finding that others may have participated in the commission of the offences would have on the question of Mr. Pickton’s criminal liability.  I will refer to these instructions compendiously as the “other suspects instructions”.  Low J.A. reviewed the relevant parts of the jury charge at some length at paras. 140-44 and 156.  This analysis need not be repeated here.  Suffice it to note that the other suspects instructions in question went along the same lines as the following instruction given to the jury immediately following the trial judge’s explanation of the elements of the offence of first degree murder:",
            "[8]  A person commits an offence if he, alone or along with somebody else or others, personally does everything necessary to constitute the offence. Accordingly, it is not necessary for you to find that Mr. Pickton acted alone in order to find him guilty of the offence.  You may find that Mr. Pickton acted in concert with other persons, although you may not know who they are.  It is sufficient if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, having considered all the evidence, that he actively participated in the killing of the victim.  It is not sufficient that he was merely present or took a minor role. The issue for you to decide is whether you are satisfied that it has been proven that he was involved to the extent that the law requires [to] establish his criminal liability.  [Emphasis added.]",
            "[24]             The other suspects instructions were responsive to the evidence and the central issues raised at trial, and they are entirely correct in law.  More importantly, on the question that occupies us, the record reveals that it was known throughout the trial to both Crown and defence counsel that the jury would be instructed along these lines. While the wording contained in earlier drafts differed somewhat from para. 8 reproduced above (see discussion at paras. 250-51 of Donald J.A.’s dissenting reasons), the crux of the anticipated other suspects instructions was the same:  it did not matter whether Mr. Pickton acted alone or with others, for he could be found criminally liable, provided that he “actively participated” in the killings, and thus had a physical role in them.  As we shall see, the impugned answer to the jury question was consistent with this instruction. In answer to the question whether they could find that Mr. Pickton was the killer if they inferred that he “acted  indirectly”, the members of the jury were ultimately instructed that they could do so, provided they found that he “was otherwise an active participant” in the killings.  The contention that the defence was somehow taken by surprise by this course of events is not, therefore, borne out on the record.",
            "[33]             Based on the evidence, the trial judge could have, and in hindsight probably should have, also instructed the jury on Mr. Pickton’s potential liability for acts of aiding and abetting, such as luring the victims to the farm, providing them with drugs or subduing them, as my colleague points out.  However, I am not persuaded that in the context of this case the failure to give such further instruction amounted to legal error.  Nothing would have been gained in this trial by explaining to the jury the distinctions between an accused’s participation as principal, co-principal, or aider and abettor.  By requiring proof that Mr. Pickton actively participated in the killing of the victims, by acting either on his own or in concert with others, there was no risk that the jury might convict him on the basis of conduct that did not attract criminal liability for the murders.  The other suspects instructions, when read in the context of the charge as a whole, effectively rendered the distinctions between these various modes of participation legally irrelevant.  The crucial issue is not whether the trial judge properly labelled the nature of Mr. Pickton’s liability.  As aptly stated in R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, “[t]he whole point of s. 21(1) is to put an aider or abettor on the same footing as the principal” (p. 689).  The determinative question is whether the trial judge correctly instructed the jury as to the essential elements which the Crown had to prove to establish Mr. Pickton’s liability for the murders.  Clearly, he was guilty of murder if the Crown proved the elements of the offences as explained in the charge to the jury.  I therefore conclude that there was no legal error.",
            "[34]             I also respectfully disagree with Donald J.A. that the failure to instruct the jury more fully on the law of aiding and abetting occasioned a miscarriage of justice.  The instructions could not have led the jury into improper reasoning.  The narrow focus which was placed on the alternate route to liability, requiring the Crown to prove that Mr. Pickton actively participated in the actual killing of the victims, restricted the scope of potential acts which could have grounded criminal liability and therefore enured to Mr. Pickton’s benefit.  I find it unhelpful to speculate on the unusual verdict of second degree murder in the context of this appeal.  As noted at the outset, the Crown successfully appealed from the six acquittals of first degree murder and the issues raised in the court below in the context of that appeal are not before us.",
            "[39]             With respect, I must therefore disagree with my colleague Charron J. that the trial judge’s overall instructions, including the re-charge following the jury’s question on the sixth day of their deliberations, can be said to have adequately conveyed the relevant legal principles as they applied to the facts of the case. She concludes that “[t]he instructions could not have led the jury into improper reasoning” (para. 34). It is indeed hazardous to speculate on the process of the jury’s deliberation, but, the unusual verdict of second degree murder returned by the jury after they posed their question may well suggest that the instructions in this case were inadequate. However, as there exists on the record overwhelming evidence of Mr. Pickton’s guilt, and no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by this error in the instructions, I would apply the curative proviso found in s. 686  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , dismiss the appeal, and affirm the convictions.",
            "A person commits an offence if he, alone or along with somebody else or others, personally does everything necessary to constitute the offence. Accordingly, it is not necessary for you to find that Mr. Pickton acted alone in order to find him guilty of the offence. You may find that Mr. Pickton acted in concert with other persons, although you may not know who they are. It is sufficient if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, having considered all the evidence, that he actively participated in the killing of the victim. It is not sufficient that he was merely present or took a minor role. The issue for you to decide is whether you are satisfied that it has been proven that he was involved to the extent that the law requires to establish his criminal liability.",
            "[45]             On the third day of the charge to the jury, the trial judge gave a more specific instruction on the possible involvement of third party suspects in the murders. He cautioned the jury that they need not determine all aspects of what happened in the case, nor whether one or more other person was involved in any or all of the counts, so long as they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Pickton had committed any or all of the offences with which he was charged.  He repeated that Mr. Pickton would be criminally liable even if the jury found that others may have been involved, so long as they were satisfied that he “actively participated” in killing a victim or victims.",
            "[50]              Although both the Crown and the defence are entitled to advance their own theories of the case as they see fit, the logical middle ground which arose on the totality of the evidence here was the possibility that, although Mr. Pickton was not necessarily the “sole perpetrator” of each of the six killings, he was still involved in the circumstances of their deaths to such an extent that criminal liability ought to extend to him as a party to the offences.  The issue on this appeal is whether the phrase “or was otherwise an active participant” in the killing, in context of the instructions as a whole, adequately conveyed to the jury the law of parties as it arose on the evidence presented at trial.

            "[51]              Generally speaking, there are two forms of liability for Criminal Code  offences, primary or principal liability (actually or personally committing the offence), and secondary liability (also known as party liability), both codified in s. 21  of the Criminal Code . Whether an accused is found guilty either as a principal offender or as a party to the offence, the result is the same in law: the accused will be convicted of the substantive offence.  It is for this reason that it is sometimes said that it is “a matter of indifference” at law whether an accused personally committed a crime, or alternatively, aided and/or abetted another to commit the offence:  R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at p. 694; Chow Bew v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 124, at p. 127.  This is also why the Crown need not specify in an indictment the nature of an accused’s participation in an offence: R. v. Harder, [1956] S.C.R. 489; Thatcher, at p. 694.",

The trial judge further advised the jury that it was “unsafe” and “dangerous” for them to rely on Mr. Niemi’s testimony unless they found some support for it in the rest of the evidence. These instructions clearly communicated to the jury that it was dangerous to rely on Mr. Niemi’s evidence absent other evidence supporting it.  However, the trial judge’s explanation of the reasons for the caution was incomplete.  He did not tell the jury that caution was required because Mr. Niemi was a jailhouse informant, that he was facing charges himself, or that he was aware a reward was offered for information about the killing. Although these facts were included in the trial judge’s summary of Mr. Niemi’s evidence, at no point in the jury charge were they linked to the need for extreme caution in relying on his evidence.",

Molodowic, 2000 SCC 16, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420), where there was uncontested evidence that the accused was incapable of knowing that his actions were morally wrong. Here, the jury was faced with conflicting expert evidence, with statements from the appellant suggesting, at some points, that he understood the moral blameworthiness of his conduct, and with the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence that could be reasonably interpreted as evidence that he knew that his acts were morally wrong. The jury could make the determination of whether the appellant had made out his defence that he was suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , on the basis of the whole of this evidence.

C-46 , he is presumed by law to have believed that he was communicating with an underage sexual target.",
            "[11] Throughout their online chat sessions, Mr. Levigne reiterated his wish to perform oral sex on “Jessy G”.  Hoping to make that wish come true, he eventually arranged to meet “Jessy G” at a local restaurant.  Upon his arrival for the anticipated sexual encounter, Mr. Levigne was instead promptly arrested and charged with three offences.  Only two are relevant here, one count each under s. 172.1(1) (a) and (c)[2] of the Criminal Code .  Essentially, both counts alleged that Mr. Levigne communicated by computer with an underage person, or person whom he believed to be underage, for the purpose of facilitating the commission, with respect to that person, of an offence mentioned in the relevant subsection.",
            "[19] On an appeal by the Crown, the Alberta Court of Appeal set aside Mr. Levigne’s acquittals, entered convictions in their stead and, pursuant to s. 686(4) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code , returned the matter to the trial court for sentencing: 2009 ABCA 359, 14 Alta. L.R. (5th) 248.",
            ". . . s. 172.1(1)(c) creates an incipient or “inchoate” offence, that is, a preparatory crime that captures otherwise legal conduct meant to culminate in the commission of a completed crime. It criminalizes conduct that precedes the commission of the sexual offences to which it refers, and even an attempt to commit them. Nor, indeed, must the offender meet or intend to meet the victim with a view to committing any of the specified secondary offences. This is in keeping with Parliament’s objective to close the cyberspace door before the predator gets in to prey. [Emphasis deleted.]",
            "In determining whether the Crown has discharged its burden under s. 172.1, it is neither necessary nor particularly helpful for trial judges to recast every element of the offence in terms of its actus reus, or “act” component, and its mens rea, or requisite mental element. As in the case of attempt, s. 172.1 criminalizes otherwise lawful conduct when its specific purpose is to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence with respect to an underage person. Separately considered, neither the conduct itself nor the purpose alone is sufficient to establish guilt: It is not an offence under s. 172.1 to communicate by computer with an underage person, nor is it an offence under s. 172.1 to facilitate the commission of a specified secondary offence in respect of that person without communicating by computer.",
            "Is it part of the actus reus that the accused communicated with a person of any age whom the accused believed to be under 14? Is it part of the mens rea that the person was in fact under 14? I see no conceptual or practical advantage in attempting to resolve these questions. It seems to me preferable, in setting out the elements of s. 172.1, to adopt “language which accurately conveys the effect of the law without in itself imposing an unnecessary burden of translation and explanation”: Howard’s Criminal Law (5th ed. 1990), at p. 11.",
            "I believe that the elements of the offence, as I have set them out, achieve that objective: They satisfy the principle of legality by affording the required degree of certainty, respecting the will of Parliament, and reflecting “the overall need to use the criminal law with restraint”: see D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (5th ed. 2007), at p. 86. [Emphasis deleted.]",
            "[38] But s. 172.1, I repeat, makes it an offence to communicate for the purpose prohibited by that section with a person whom the accused believes to be underage.  That is in itself conduct deemed undesirable and criminalized by Parliament.  It thus seems more incongruous still to acquit an accused who communicated for a prohibited sexual purpose with a person whom he believed to be underage — the evil aimed at — on the ground that he would not have made that mistake had he taken the reasonable steps he was required by law to take.",
            "[39] The appellant concedes that the trial judge erred in declining to apply s. 172.1(4)  of the Criminal Code  to the evidence before him, but urges us nonetheless to restore the appellant’s acquittals or, in the alternative, to set aside the convictions substituted by the Court of Appeal and to order a new trial instead."

        "Facts": "[146]This case involves thesenselesskilling of a stranger by the appellant who was out on the town in Vancouver in the early hours of the morning of December 3, 2005.  He was carrying and showing off a Glock firearm.  The victim, Lee Matasi, was shot and killed after a scuffle outside a nightclub.  Earlier that evening, Mr. Matasi had been drinking in Gastown with some friends.  On his way home, he encountered the appellant on the street outside another club.  As stated, they were unknown to each other. [147]According to the appellant’s ex-girlfriend, he was being loud, he was “in the party mode”, and according to another witness he seemed “very aggravated”.  At one point, the appellant lifted up his shirt to show some people he had a gun.  Other witnesses heard someone question whether the gun was real, and watched as the appellant shot at a building to prove that it was, saying “It’s not real, right”, in a sarcastic voice. [148]During this exchange, Mr. Matasi volunteered the comment that said, “It’s not cool shooting a gun”.  Mr. Matasi and his friends were intoxicated.  One witness heard them yell something to the effect of:  “Why don’t you shoot the gun again?” or “Shoot the window out”.  Another said they yelled “Smash the window, smash that truck”.  The appellant yelled back at Mr. Matasi’s group and went up the hill in their direction.  When the appellant reached the Matasi group he picked a fight with Mr. Matasi.  A scuffle ensued.  At one point the gun went off.  It came loose on the ground but was recovered by the appellant.  The struggle continued. [149]At this point accounts diverge.  Some witnesses said that before the second — fatal — shot went off, both men were standing grappling with each other.  However, the Crown’s main witness, who had not been drinking, described seeing a person he identified as the appellant holding up another man who had his rear end on the ground, and had his legs splayed out in front of him.  The appellant was standing uphill from the first, was holding the other up by the scruff of his neck, and was in a fit of rage.  He was pointing a firearm down at the other man.  This witness said he heard the word “bitch”, just before he heard a shot being fired.  The Crown urged the jury to believe the second version and return a verdict of murder.  The defence urged acceptance of the first version andafinding ofmanslaughter.  Mr. Matasi died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. [150]After the shot was fired, the appellant immediately fled the scene, and ran into an alley.  The police watched as he deposited something into a dumpster.  The appellant was arrested, and a Glock firearm was retrieved from amongst the rubbish.  At trial, he did not testify.  Crown counsel in his closing submissions stated to the jury that they could draw an inference from the appellant’s “immediate flight” after the shooting that the appellant was guilty of murder.  The Crown submitted that the appellant’s lack of hesitation before fleeing indicated that he acted with an intent to kill.  The permissible use of evidence of the post-gunshot demeanour and flight of the appellant forms the subject matter of the appeal.  If the trial judge is found to have erred (as unanimously found by the B.C. Court of Appeal), the Crown nevertheless argues that the conviction of second degree murder should be upheld by the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of theCriminal Code.",

        "Facts": "[4]On July 22, 2007, a vehicle driven by the appellant, Samuel Dineley, struck a parked vehicle. He was asked to submit to breathalyzer tests. The instrument registered 99 and 97 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood. He was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit of 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of blood. [5]At the beginning of the trial, on June 19, 2008, counsel for Mr. Dineley advised the judge that he would not be able to complete the case for the defence that day. He intended to tender a toxicology report in support of aCarterdefence in order to challenge the accuracy of the breathalyzer test results; Crown counsel had asked to cross-examine the toxicologist on his report, but the latter was not present. The hearing started that day on the common understanding that the case for the defence would be continued on July 15, 2008 to enable the Crown to cross-examine the toxicologist. Both Crown and defence counsel were or ought to have been aware that the Amendments would come into force on July 2, 2008.Section 258(1)(c) of theCriminalCode, as amended by the Amendments, establishes a presumption of accuracy of breathalyzer test results and a presumption of identity of those results with the blood alcohol level of the accused at the time of the alleged offence. Under s. 258(1)(c), these presumptions will now be rebutted only if the accused leads evidence tending to show that the instrument malfunctioned or was improperly operated.  The effect of that provision, together with s. 258(1)(d.01), is to eliminate theCarterdefence as an independent means to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of breathalyzer test results. [6]The trial judge did not allow the Crown to argue that the Amendments applied to preclude aCarterdefence. In his opinion, it was improper for the Crown to obtain an adjournment for purposes of cross-examining the toxicologist and then invoke the Amendments which came into force in the interim without having first warned defence counsel that it intended to do so. He accepted theCarterdefence and acquitted Mr. Dineley. [7]The summary conviction appeal judge held that it was not improper for the Crown to raise the issue of the applicability of the Amendments.  However, he was of the view that the Amendments virtually eliminated theCarterdefence, that they were substantive in nature and not procedural, and that they therefore applied only prospectively. [8]The Court of Appeal reversed that decision. It held that the Amendments were merely evidentiary and that they therefore applied to the case. According to MacPherson J.A., writing for the court, theCarterdefence had not been eliminated: it had been changed, but survived in a different form (2009 ONCA 814, 98 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 26).  The court ordered a new trial to proceed on the basis ofs. 258(1)of theCriminal Codeas amended.",

        "Facts": "A.Manasie Ipeelee [102]Manasie Ipeelee, an Inuk, was born on December 28, 1972, in Iqaluit and grew up in that community.  He suffered a tragic upbringing, which saw the death of his alcoholic mother when he was a child and the development of his own serious alcohol addiction by the time he was 12 years old.  His life is marked by an ever-present alcohol addiction coupled with a propensity to inflict brutal violence on those with whom he comes into contact while intoxicated. [103]From the age of 12 to 18, he accumulated a record of 36 convictions, mostly property-related.  As an adult, Mr. Ipeelee continued to commit property offences, but added to them a series of increasingly violent crimes.  The series of violent offences began in September 1992, when he was 19.  On this occasion, he attacked a man with an ashtray and chair when he was refused entry into the victim’s home.  He pled guilty to assault causing bodily harm and was sentenced to 21 days’ imprisonment followed by one year’s probation. [104]In August 1993, he committed a second  assault causing bodily harm when, while on probation for the prior offence, he beat an individual unconscious outside a bar in Iqaluit, kicking him in the face at least 10 times and continuing the assault after the individual had lost consciousness.  This attack left the victim hospitalized.  Less than one year later he pled guilty to yet another aggravated assault.  This time the victim was hospitalized after being beaten to unconsciousness by Mr. Ipeelee, who then continued to stomp on his face.  Mr. Ipeelee was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment for the August 1993 offence and 14 months for the subsequent offence. [105]Three weeks after receiving early release from prison for this attack, he committed a sexual assault in which he and another man raped a woman who had passed out from intoxication at a party.  He pled guilty and received a sentence of two years in prison.  A consecutive eight-month sentence was added for his escape from prison two days before the plea and sentencing hearing.  In the six months after his release for this offence, he was arrested at least nine times for public intoxication. [106]In August 1999, he committed a sexual assault causing bodily harm when he raped a homeless woman, during the course of which he threatened to kill her, and punched her repeatedly in the face.  The woman required treatment in hospital for her injuries.  It was this crime that led to his designation as a long-term offender.  At the hearing the sentencing judge noted (2001 NWTSC 33, [2001] N.W.T.J. No. 30 (QL)): This summary of Mr. Ipeelee’s crimes of violence shows a consistent pattern of Mr. Ipeelee administering gratuitous violence against vulnerable, helpless people while he is in a state of intoxication. [para. 34] Mr. Ipeelee was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for this offence to be followed by a 10-year LTSO. [107]The offence that led to this appeal occurred in August 2008 after Mr. Ipeelee had been on release for 17 months.  On this occasion, police found Mr. Ipeelee intoxicated in downtown Kingston and he was charged with breaching the abstention from intoxicants condition of his LTSO.  He pled guilty on November 14, 2008, and received a sentence of three years in prison. B.Frank Ralph Ladue [108]Frank Ladue is a member of the Ross River Dena Council, an Aboriginal community of approximately 500 individuals located 400 kilometres northeast of Whitehorse.  He was born in 1962 and, like Mr. Ipeelee, suffered a tragic childhood, with both alcoholic parents dying while he was quite young.  At the age of five, he was sent to a residential school and on his return, he lived with his grandparents.  It was then, at the age of nine, that he began drinking.  He has continued to have serious problems with alcohol and drugs throughout his life, with the exception of a six-year period of sobriety in the 1990s, a time when he was also free of convictions. [109]Mr. Ladue has a criminal record of 40 convictions.  It includes a lengthy list of property and impaired driving offences.  He has two convictions for robbery, and two convictions for common assault.  His most serious convictions stem from a series of sexual assaults.  The first occurred in 1987 when he sexually assaulted an unconscious woman at a party.  In 1998, he was convicted of breaking and entering.  During the break and enter, he placed a sleeping bag over a sleeping woman’s head and shoulders, but fled when her daughter interrupted him.  Although he was not convicted of sexual assault, the sentencing judge at Mr. Ladue’s 2003 hearing, where he was designated a long-term offender, found the incident “eerily similar” to the previous sexual assaults (2003 YKTC 100 (CanLII), at para. 7).  In June of 1999, he was found guilty of sexually assaulting yet another unconscious woman.  For the 1987 conviction, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 23 months, for the 1998 conviction 4 months and for the 1999 conviction 30 months. [110]His most recent sexual assault occurred in 2002.  On this occasion he entered a dwelling house without permission from the occupants and found a 22-year-old woman in the living room unconscious due to alcohol consumption.  When she awoke, Mr. Ladue was assaulting her and attempting to remove her pants.  She was unable to resist due to her intoxication, but the attack was interrupted when other residents of the house were awakened by what was happening and Mr. Ladue escaped from the home.  He was convicted following a trial for break and enter and sexual assault and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.  It was this offence that caused him to be found a long-term offender. [111]Mr. Ladue was released under a seven-year LTSO in December 2006.  During the time between his release and the breach in question in this appeal, he was convicted for breaching his LTSO by consuming intoxicants on three occasions and sentenced in total to two years in prison, with 16 and a half months credited for pre-sentence custody.  On May 23, 2009, he had his LTSO suspended for the tenth time between December 2006 and May 2009 and remained in custody until August 12, 2009. [112]Upon release he was designated by the Correctional Service of Canada (“CSC”) to be sent to Linkage House in Kamloops, British Columbia, where he would receive culturally specific support from an Aboriginal Elder.  However, an outstanding warrant requiring Mr. Ladue to submit to a DNA test was discovered at the time of his release.  Apparently, due to a bureaucratic error, the warrant had not been executed during his period of detention and, according to counsel for Mr. Ladue in this Court, may have been altogether unnecessary, as a DNA sample may have been provided under a previous warrant.  The warrant required that he appear in Surrey, B.C.  This resulted in Mr. Ladue being sent to Belkin House, in downtown Vancouver, which did not offer the specialized support of Linkage House in Kamloops.  Upon arrival, he was informed that his residency status did not allow an immediate transfer to Linkage House and that he would have to remain at Belkin House until the National Parole Board made the necessary change to his status.  Within one week of his arrival at Belkin House, he reoffended and was subsequently charged with breaching his LTSO by consuming intoxicants.  He pled guilty in February 2010 and received a sentence of three years in prison.",

        "Facts": "[2]The complainant alleged that on two occasions the appellant had non-consensual sexual intercourse with her while she was sleeping with him in his bed. She was 17 at the time of both incidents; he was 22 at the time of the first and 23 at the time of the second. The trial judge found that the two incidents described by the complainant had occurred.  The main issue, in his view, was whether the sexual activity had been proved to be without the complainant’s consent ([2009] O.J. No. 6377 (QL)). [3]The judge found that the appellant had “adopted a lifestyle” that included regular parties at his home and providing young women — including the complainant and her 15-year-old sister — with alcohol (para. 27). [4]The first incident described by the complainant occurred in February 2006.  The complainant and appellant were socializing in his apartment, including drinking alcohol that he had provided.  The complainant’s younger sister as well as the appellant’s roommate and another friend were also present, but the friend left before the others went to sleep.  At the end of the evening, the complainant’s sister went to sleep on the couch, the roommate went to sleep in his room and the appellant and complainant went to sleep in the appellant’s bed.  The complainant testified her sleeping in the appellant’s bed had not been discussed beforehand. [5]The complainant testified that in the early hours of the morning, the appellant moved closer to her and began grabbing and touching her.  She testified that she said “stop” but that he eventually had unprotected intercourse with her.  She got up, cleaned herself off, walked around the house and returned to bed with the appellant, although she did not sleep.  Later in the morning, she got up, woke up her sister and they left.  She did not mention the incident, and her sister testified that nothing seemed amiss.  The complainant’s sister, however, testified that when she woke up on this occasion, the complainant was in the appellant’s bedroom.  When questioned about this apparent inconsistency between her evidence and that of the complainant, her sister responded that she could be confusing it with a different time when they were at the appellant’s house. [6]The second incident reported by the complainant occurred in May 2006.  She again found herself at the appellant’s apartment, after they both had participated in a long day of moving.  She testified that she did not know how she ended up staying the night again.  This time, they were alone.  After watching movies, they retired to his bed.  Once again, she testified that he began touching and kissing her, and that she said “no” before they had unprotected intercourse.  Afterwards, she was “too on edge” to leave the apartment, despite having a car, so she returned to the same bed and went to sleep.  She left the next day and did not tell anyone about the occurrence. [7]The complainant posted a poem online.  The judge found that it had been written very soon after the February 2006 incident “as an outlet” (para. 29).  Her sister saw the poem on the Internet and the incidents came to light when she began to discuss it with the complainant.  The complainant filed a police report, and the appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault.  At trial, the appellant testified and denied any sexual contact with the complainant. [8]The trial judge acquitted the appellant on both counts.  After summarizing virtually all of the evidence the trial judge found that he had “absolutely no doubt” (para. 26) that sexual intercourse had taken place between the appellant and complainant; he specifically rejected the appellant’s denials in this regard (para. 36). [9]However, the trial judge acknowledged that he also had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual activity had occurred without the complainant’s consent.  He noted some “concerns” in this regard. He referred to the sister’s evidence that she might have been confused between the times that she saw the complainant in the appellant’s bed.  The judge said that this caused him to wonder how many times the complainant had ended up in the appellant’s bed.  He asked himself “why did [the complainant] insist in going back to the same bed that she had been violated in?” (para. 34).  The judge then noted that he suspected “very strongly” that the complainant was confused and that she “wrestled” with going into the accused’s bedroom.  He returned to the fact that “[s]he said she went to the bed on her own and it wasn’t even discussed.  Why?” (para. 35). [10]The trial judge referred to the poem the complainant had written, entitled “Black Dark”, and quoted it in its entirety in his oral reasons.  As noted, he accepted both that it was written very shortly after the February incident, and that it had been written as an outlet.  He then stated, “[w]hen I read [the complainant’s] description of the incidents on February 11th, concerns are raised” (para. 31).  He noted that the words “bittersweet” and “regret” which she had used in the poem were “[h]ardly the words that describe a rape” (para. 33).  The trial judge then concluded that “[i]n all of the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding that I do not believe the accused, notwithstanding that I am satisfied that sexual intercourse did occur on both of these occasions, I cannot be satisfied that [the complainant] was sexually assaulted without her consent” (para. 36). [11]The Crown appealed successfully to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the acquittals and ordered a new trial on both counts of the indictment (2009 ONCA 834, 256 O.A.C. 246).  The court concluded that the trial judge erred in law in his approach to the evidence.  Specifically, it found that he failed to consider some lines of the poem in the context of the others, and that he failed to consider the poem in the context of the complainant’s testimony on consent.  This, according to Watt J.A., was a “piecemeal” approach which was incompatible with the trial judge’s obligations to consider the cumulative effect of all relevant evidence (para. 64) and constituted an error of law as set out in this Court’s decision inR. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57. [12]The appellant argues that the trial judge did not approach the evidence in a “piecemeal” fashion. The appellant further argues that even if the trial judge did err as the Court of Appeal suggested, the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to entertain a Crown appeal because any error was an error of fact and not an error of law alone as is required bys. 676(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  The respondent Crown argues that, as held by the Court of Appeal, the trial judge did err in law by considering the evidence in a piecemeal fashion.",

        "Facts": "[4]On May 22, 2007, the respondent J.A. and his long-time partner K.D. spent an evening together at home.   While watching a movie on the couch, they started to kiss and engage in foreplay.  After some time, they went upstairs to their bedroom and became more intimate.  They both undressed, and started kissing on the bed. [5]While K.D. was lying on her back, J.A. placed his hands around her throat and choked her until she was unconscious.  At trial, K.D. estimated that she was unconscious for “less than three minutes”.  She testified that she consented to J.A. choking her, and understood that she might lose consciousness.  She stated that she and J.A. had experimented with erotic asphyxiation, and that she had lost consciousness before. [6]When K.D. regained consciousness, she was on her knees at the edge of the bed with her hands tied behind her back, and J.A. was inserting a dildo into her anus.  K.D. gave conflicting testimony about whether this was the first time J.A. had inserted a dildo into her anus.  During her examination in chief, she stated that this was a first, and initially maintained this answer during cross-examination by defence counsel: [Mr. Goldstein]: In terms of having what you referred to as a dildo inserted -- you had said in your butt, is that something that had happened before? [K.D.]: No, we hadn’t done that.  We discussed the possibility of it.  At the moment I just went with it in the spirit of experimentation. [7]However, when confronted with the transcript of her testimony at J.A.’s bail hearing, K.D. changed her answer: [K.D.]: . . . we had tried it one time prior.  [Mr. Goldstein]: Okay. . . .  [K.D.]: Somewhat of a drunken evening a while ago.  I do apologize. [8]K.D. testified that J.A. removed the dildo ten seconds after she regained consciousness.   The two then had vaginal intercourse.  When they had finished, J.A. cut K.D.’s hands loose. [9]K.D. made a complaint to the police on July 11.  In a videotaped statement, she told the police that she had not consented to the sexual activity that had occurred.She later recanted her allegation, and claimed that she made a false complaint to the police because J.A. had threatened to seek sole custody of their two-year-old son.J.A. was charged with aggravated assault, sexual assault, attempting to render the complainant unconscious in order to sexually assault her, and with breaching his probation order.",

        ],
        "Facts": "[4]The relevant facts of this case are not in dispute.  For the purposes of this appeal, it will suffice to mention that the appellant, Tommy Bouchard‑Lebrun, and a long‑time acquaintance of his, Yohann Schmouth, had smoked marijuana and taken amphetamines during the day on October 23, 2005.  In the evening, they decided to go to Amqui so the appellant could visit his parents.  They took the bus from Rivière‑du‑Loup, where the appellant lived, to the last stop in Mont‑Joli.  They were still intoxicated when they got on the bus. [5]When they arrived in Mont‑Joli during the night on October 24, the appellant and his friend decided to hitchhike to Amqui.  At about 1:30 a.m., Gilles Tremblay, an old acquaintance of the appellant’s family, picked them up in his car.  At that time, no signs of intoxication were apparent from the appellant’s behaviour.  At trial, Mr. Tremblay stated that he had not noticed anything unusual about the appellant at any time during the car trip.  His statements confirmed Mr. Schmouth’s testimony that the appellant was [translation] “OK” again when they were around Val‑Brillant, a municipality about 15 kilometres from Amqui.  Therefore, it seems that the drugs taken by the appellant during the day on October 23 had ceased to have effect before he arrived in Amqui with Mr. Schmouth. [6]In Amqui, the two young men purchased ecstasy pills of a type known as “poire bleue”, which they took during the night on October 24.  During the hours that followed, the appellant and Mr. Schmouth decided to go and beat up Dany Lévesque, who was known as “Pee‑Wee”, for the real or imagined reason that he wore an [translation] “upside‑down cross” around his neck.  Around 5:00 a.m., the appellant and Mr. Schmouth illegally entered the building where Mr. Lévesque lived.  Roger Dumas, who lived on the second floor of the building, was woken up by noise coming from the ground floor and went down to Mr. Lévesque’s apartment to find out what was going on.  The two occupants of the building met in the stairs and realized that the appellant and Mr. Schmouth were there, and the latter two then brutally attacked Mr. Lévesque by punching and kicking him many times. [7]Mr. Dumas saw that Mr. Lévesque could not defend himself against his two attackers and tried to intervene.  The appellant grabbed him and threw him violently down the stairs.  Mr. Dumas lay on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.  The appellant went down to where he was and stomped on his head.  The assault left Mr. Dumas disabled, and he will have to spend the rest of his life in a hospital. [8]At the time of the assault, the appellant was highly intoxicated because of the effects of the “poire bleue” pill he had taken a few hours earlier.  In addition to the “normal” symptoms of intoxication resulting from the use of that drug, the highly toxic pill had produced a striking and, according to the appellant, unanticipated effect on him, as it caused a complete dissociation between the appellant’s subjective perceptions and the objective reality.  To put it bluntly, he was [translation] “on another planet”.  Two witnesses at the trial stated that he [translation] “started acting weird” and was “completely out of it” after taking the “poire bleue” pill. [9]In actual fact, the appellant experienced an episode that might be described as religious delirium in light of its symptoms.  It was after taking the drug that he became obsessed with the “upside‑down cross” supposedly worn by Mr. Lévesque.  During the attack, he made statements of a religious nature that, although coherent, were basically absurd.  For example, he said that the Apocalypse was coming.  At one point, he raised his arms in the air and asked the victims and the helpless witnesses to the attack whether they believed in him.  After referring a few times to God and the Devil once the attack was over, he blessed Mr. Dumas’s spouse by making the sign of the cross on her forehead.  Mr. Dumas was still lying on the floor when the appellant then left the scene very calmly as if nothing had just happened. [10]It has never been in dispute, in any of the courts, that the appellant was in a serious psychotic condition at the time of the offences and that the effects of that condition diminished gradually until they disappeared on October 28, 2005.  The essential issue in this appeal is instead how that psychosis affects the appellant’s criminal responsibility.  I will consider this issue later in these reasons.  For now, it will suffice to note that, according to the evidence, the appellant had never experienced a psychotic episode such as this prior to the incidents in question.  He had no underlying disease of the mind, nor was he addicted to a particular substance.  Although he described himself at trial as an [translation] “occasional user” of drugs, the evidence does not establish that he “abused” drugs — if it can be said that occasional drug use does not constitute abuse, that is. [11]As a result of these incidents, the appellant was charged with committing aggravated assault on Mr. Dumas and Mr. Lévesque contrary to ss. 266(a) and 268Cr. C., and with breaking and entering a dwelling‑house with intent to commit an indictable offence and attempting to break and enter a place other than a dwelling-house contrary to ss. 348(1)(a) and 463Cr. C.He pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.",

            "[1]                              Dangerous driving causing death is a serious criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Like all criminal offences, it consists of two components: prohibited conduct — operating a motor vehicle in a dangerous manner resulting in death — and a required degree of fault — a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in all the circumstances.  The fault component is critical, as it ensures that criminal punishment is only imposed on those deserving the stigma of a criminal conviction.  While a mere departure from the standard of care justifies imposing civil liability, only a marked departure justifies the fault requirement for this serious criminal offence.",
            "[2]                              Defining and applying this fault element is important, but also challenging, given the inherently dangerous nature of driving.  Even simple carelessness may result in tragic consequences which may tempt judges and juries to unduly extend the reach of the criminal law to those responsible.  Yet, as the Court put it in R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para. 34, “If every departure from the civil norm is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally blameworthy”.  Giving careful attention to the fault element of the offence is essential if we are to avoid making criminals out of the merely careless.",

        "Facts": "A.Overview of the Facts [5]The appellant pulled his motor home out from a stop sign onto a highway and into the path of an oncoming tractor-trailer.  In the collision that resulted, the appellant’s passenger was killed.  The appellant was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.  The facts are as simple as they are tragic. [6]On an afternoon in late November 2004, the appellant and Mark Anthony Harrington decided to return home after work at a sawmill near Vavenby, a town north of Kamloops, British Columbia.  They left work together in the appellant’s motor home to head back to a trailer park where they lived.  They took a shortcut via the Harmon Road to reach Highway 5, the Southern Yellowhead Highway, and then planned to head south on the highway to the trailer park.[1]The Harmon Road is an unpaved back road which becomes relatively steep as it approaches the intersection with the highway.  The appellant knew the Harmon Road well, having driven it to and from Highway 5 about 500 times before. [7]The Harmon Road intersects with Highway 5 in such a way that vehicles intending to turn from the road onto the highway to head south, as the appellant did to return to the trailer park, usually first veer towards the north in order to come squarely to the intersection.  This enables them to better see the oncoming northbound traffic and better determine when it is safe to turn left, and cross the northbound lanes to head south.  Constable Campbell testified that to turn onto the highway, he has “to turn towards the right so I can come square at the intersection so I can see both ways” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 167).  That afternoon, visibility was limited due to fog and the Harmon Road was snow-covered and slippery. [8]On the afternoon of the accident, Michael McGinnis, accompanied by his daughter Darlene, was driving a tractor-trailer northbound on the highway.  As he was approaching the Harmon Road intersection at about 3:00 p.m., the fog was thickening and the visibility was poor.  The trial judge accepted Mr. McGinnis’s evidence that the weather conditions led him to decrease his speed to between 75 and 80 kilometres per hour.  That was the speed he was driving when, from a distance, he noticed the headlights of what we now know to have been the appellant’s vehicle pointing towards him from what Mr. McGinnis assumed was the shoulder of the highway or the top of the side road. Although the trial judge did not make a specific finding on the point, both Mr. McGinnis and his passenger thought that the appellant’s vehicle had stopped before proceeding onto the highway, although his passenger was not sure.  Mr. McGinnis also testified that when he first saw the lights of the appellant’s vehicle, he guessed that it was about 300-400 feet away but that it could have been as little as 100 feet. [9]When Mr. McGinnis saw the headlights, he took his foot off the accelerator.  When he then realized that the appellant’s vehicle was proceeding onto the highway, he applied his brakes, but it was too late.  His truck violently collided with the appellant’s vehicle, killing Mr. Harrington.  The appellant survived, but the collision left him with no memory of either its circumstances or of the surrounding events. [10]The appellant was charged with and convicted of dangerous driving causing the death of Mr. Harrington, contrary tos. 249(4)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  The relevant provisions read as follows:",

            "[1]                              Binnie J. — The only issue on this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in substituting a conviction instead of ordering a new trial on three counts of sexual assault.  It was established in R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, that “[t]he test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the requisite sexual nature is an objective one: ‘Viewed in the light of all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible to a reasonable observer?’” (p. 302).  As found by the Court of Appeal, the trial judge misdirected himself on this question of law.  Sexual assault does not require proof of an improper or ulterior purpose.  The Crown at trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching of the complainants occurred in circumstances of a sexual nature such as to compromise the sexual integrity of the complainants.  Section 686(4) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , permits an appellate court on appeal from a judge alone to “enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law”.  Here the Crown established that an error of law was committed at trial, and that but for that error the appellant would necessarily have been convicted: R. v. Cassidy, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 345.  Accordingly, despite the able submissions of Mr. Kapoor, we are all of the view that the Court of Appeal reached the proper conclusion.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."

        "Facts": "[7]In March 2005, Sgt. Kevin Brezinski of the Edmonton drug squad obtained and executed a search warrant at the home of Irfan Qureshi based in part on the information provided by a confidential police informer.  The police seized 1.5 kg each of methamphetamine and cocaine, three handguns, a bulletproof vest and paraphernalia for cooking and packaging cocaine.  In the same month a second search netted a seizure of 4 kg of cocaine, 6 oz. of methamphetamine, a handgun, and $55,000.  Qureshi and others were charged with a number of drug trafficking and firearms offences. [8]Defence counsel retained the appellant Ross Barros, a private investigator, to look into the strengths and weaknesses of the Crown’s case.  Mr. Barros is a retired police officer with 25 years of experience with the Edmonton police service, seven of which were engaged in investigating drug crimes. [9]Mr. Barros decided to take steps to discover the informer’s identity.  According to the theory of the prosecution, he met with Qureshi’s associates, told them he was working for the defence and was going to find out who had informed on Qureshi.  He demanded the associates’ cell phone numbers to see if any of them had been in touch with the investigating officer, Sgt. Brezinski.  Mr. Barros warned them that the informer in their midst should seek legal advice and contact him so that they could “work this thing together”. [10]Mr. Barros obtained the associates’ call records from sources unknown.  He also compared the criminal record of each of the associates against the disclosed criminal record of the informer to eliminate potential candidates.  He helped identify a polygraph operator, and suggested that those of Qureshi’s associates who had not provided their cell phone numbers should instead participate in a polygraph test.  He later began approaching individuals, telling each that he “knew” that person was the informer. [11]Mirza Kassam, the only one of the associates to testify at trial, said he arrived late at the initial meeting in which Mr. Barros requested the associates’ phone numbers.  He left his name and number on a piece of Mr. Barros’s letterhead.  After Kassam missed a subsequent meeting, he was instructed to call Mr. Barros, whom he later met in a parking lot.  Mr. Barros told him, “[Y]ou’re the informant”.  Kassam says he denied the accusation but was afraid of falling under suspicion because “out there, informants get killed”.  Mr. Barros demanded Kassam’s cell phone records.  Kassam said he felt that if he did not comply, Mr. Barros would conclude that he was the informer.  Kassam testified to his belief that Mr. Barros wanted him to confess so that Mr. Barros could put it to the police that he knew who their source was and get the charges dropped.  Kassam said that after this meeting, despite his denial, the other associates became very hostile towards him and he feared that he might be killed.  (The trial judge found this evidence to be wholly unreliable.) [12]Mr. Barros eventually arranged a meeting with Sgt. Brezinski for May 6, 2005, at a local golf course.  Sgt. Krewenchuk was also present at this meeting.  Qureshi had a bail hearing scheduled for the same date.  Sgt. Brezinski had already recommended bail for Qureshi on strict conditions.  Mr.Barros advised Sgt. Brezinski (up until that time a personal friend) that he knew the identity of the informer but that he had not revealed this information to Qureshi.  Nor was he going to advise his retaining counsel of the informer’s identity “at this time”. [13]Mr. Barros told Sgt. Brezinski and Sgt. Krewenchuk of several cases Mr. Barros recalled from his time on the Edmonton police force where the charges against an accused were dropped in order to protect the informer once the identity of an informer was discovered.  Mr. Barros said that although he had not told anyone about the informer’s identity, he would eventually have to report it to defence counsel.  Sgt. Brezinski testified that he understood Mr. Barros to be asking him to drop the charges against Qureshi if he didn’t want the identity of the informer to be revealed.  Sgt. Brezinski told Mr. Barros that he was committing extortion and obstruction of justice. [14]Mr. Barros was charged with one count of obstructing justice for taking investigative steps to identify a confidential police source “for the purpose of interfering with criminal proceedings” against Irfan Qureshi.  He was also charged with two counts of extortion, firstly for attempting to induce Sgt. Brezinski to withdraw the criminal proceedings against Qureshi at the May 6 meeting and, secondly, for inducing or attempting to induce the associates of Qureshi (including Kassam) to give him personal information including cellular phone numbers between March 7 and May 12, 2005. [15]In a cautioned statement to police on May 13, 2005, following his arrest, Mr. Barros said that he knew the identity of the informer and was aware that the person thus identified would be in danger if this were disclosed, even if his “identification” turned out to be mistaken.  He agreed that following the arrest of one of its members, a criminal organization will often attempt to identify and eliminate police informers within their group. [16]Mr. Barros said in his police statement that he knew from previous experience that the protection of an informer’s identity was a paramount concern of the police.  He added that he believed it was routine for the Crown and the police to stay the charges against an accused where this became necessary to protect the identity of an informer.  He offered a number of examples in which he had done so as a police officer.  He said, however, that he had been motivated in his investigation of Qureshi’s associates to ensure that no harm befell the “source” thus identified.",

            "[9]                              Apart from a few notable exceptions — such as when an accused raises the defence of not criminally responsible on account of a mental disorder under s. 16  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  — in every criminal trial, juries are instructed that an accused has no obligation to prove anything.  The onus of proof rests upon the Crown from beginning to end and it never shifts.",
            "[10]                          Juries are also told that in deciding whether the Crown has proved its case to the criminal standard, they are to look to the whole of the evidence — and, having done so, they may only convict if they are satisfied, on the basis of evidence they find to be both credible and reliable, that the Crown has established the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  In coming to that conclusion, a jury may not use an accused’s silence at trial as evidence, much less evidence of guilt, and, where appropriate, the jury should be so instructed.",
            "[14]                          Despite his strong language, I consider it significant that neither the trial judge, on his own motion, nor counsel who was acting for Mr. Prokofiew at the time, raised the prospect of severance.  The option of severing Mr. Prokofiew’s trial from Mr. Solty’s was clearly open if the trial judge believed that severance was warranted in the interests of justice: Criminal Code , s. 591(3) (b) — and it would have solved the problem if, as Mr. Prokofiew now argues and my colleague accepts, the risk identified by the trial judge was so great that it could not be overcome by instructions tailored to address, albeit indirectly, the erroneous message conveyed by Mr. Solty’s counsel.  Presumably, Mr. Prokofiew’s trial counsel ascribed to the view that the judge’s instructions to the jury would suffice, and thus refrained from moving for severance.  I prefer to view the matter that way, rather than to treat his failure to move for severance as a tactical decision designed to preserve a ground of appeal should things go badly at trial.",
            "[28]                          My colleague, however, maintains that the admission of the impugned documents was sufficiently serious to preclude the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  He points out that the Crown’s case against Mr. Prokofiew rested almost entirely on the evidence of two disreputable witnesses, Messrs. Solty and Tulloch (the latter being a co-accused who had pled guilty before the trial of Messrs. Solty and Prokofiew and had since become a Crown witness).  The jury was told to proceed with caution and to look for confirmatory evidence before acting on their testimony to convict Mr. Prokofiew.  Depending on their assessment of the cheque stubs and deposit book, the jury was instructed that those items could constitute confirmatory evidence of Mr. Tulloch’s testimony, which in turn would bear on the jury’s evaluation of Mr. Solty’s credibility.  Hence, according to my colleague, the error was not harmless, because the jury “may [have relied] on the impugned evidence to take a small but critical first step in a chain of deductions leading to a finding of guilt” (para. 111).",
            "[63]                          In the result, the Court of Appeal found that the erroneous admission of the hearsay evidence “caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” (para. 54), applied the curative proviso of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and dismissed Mr. Prokofiew’s appeal.",
            "[113]                      In these circumstances, the Crown cannot be said to have satisfied its onerous burden in invoking the curative proviso of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .",

        "Facts": "[15]Mr. Katigbak was charged with one count of possession of child pornography after the police found 628 images (of which 61 were duplicates) and 30 video clips of child pornography on his computer’s external hard drive.  Of the 628 images, 616 were “accessible”, defined at trial as “ones which can be located by any computer user with a minimum of effort” (Agreed Statement of Facts (A.R., at p. 183)).  All of these materials showed the actual abuse of real children, including babies.  Some of the images depicted children engaging in sexual activity with adults and other children, while others showed children exposing their genitals, and being anally and vaginally penetrated. [16]At trial, Mr. Katigbak admitted that all of the images of children constituted child pornography within the meaning ofs. 163.1(1)of theCriminal Code, and that he had collected them between 1999 and 2006.  However, he contended that he only collected child pornography because he intended to create an artistic exhibition exploring the sexual exploitation of children.  As such, he argued that he was entitled to rely on the defence in s. 163.1(6) for artistic expression.  He explained that his artistic project would not include any images of actual child pornography, but rather that he would try to convey the psychological effect of child abuse by using mannequins and dolls. [17]Mr. Katigbak stated at trial that he collected child pornography to research what child pornography looked like and then explore his emotional responses to it.  He explained that he knew that viewing images would invoke an “extreme sense of anger” and that he wanted “those feelings to be fresh” when he was working on the project (A.R., at p. 93). [18]Investigators also found a large collection of adult pornography intermingled with the images of child pornography on Mr. Katigbak’s computer.  When asked in cross-examination, Mr. Katigbak stated that the images of adult pornography found in his possession were not related to the proposed art project but for “personal entertainment” (A.R., at p. 113).  He admitted to making no effort to isolate the child pornography from the adult images on his computer.  He also took no steps to add safeguards on the computer, such as adding password protections to the child pornography files.  He confirmed in his testimony that the computer was out in the open and whoever wanted to use it had access to it.  On a daily basis, this included his father and brother, and occasionally at parties, up to 30 or 40 people. [19]Mr. Katigbak testified that he conceived of this art project on child pornography while he was completing a Bachelor’s degree in psychology at McMaster University.  As evidence, he introduced his notebooks from 2000, 2001 and 2003 in which he wrote about how such an exhibit could be created.  In one such entry, Mr. Katigbak wrote:  “[H]ow do you do a show on child porn?  (you can’t show it) — maybe do a documentary?  . . . models should show a broken spirit, fear, helplessness — show a child w/ an adult in the background (looming or doing-up his pants after the abuse has occurred)” (A.R., at p. 239). [20]Mr. Katigbak also spent a number of years working in the photography industry, and testified that he hoped his exhibit on child pornography would draw attention to his work.  One of his colleagues from Japan Camera Centre, Stacey Tyrell, testified that she and Mr. Katigbak discussed various ideas for artistic projects.  She testified that, in early 2004, the two talked about using child mannequins in an artistic project after they saw a store window that displayed undressed child mannequins.  Mr. Katigbak never specifically spoke to her about a project relating to the sexual abuse of children, but she stated that this was one of the themes that they discussed.  He never told her that he was collecting child pornography as part of an art project. [21]By the time Mr. Katigbak was charged with possession of child pornography in 2006, seven years had passed since he had started collecting the materials.  He had never produced an exhibition, nor had he secured a venue for one.  He testified that he had not found an appropriate venue that he could afford, and that he nonetheless continued to collect child pornography “even if it was redundant at that point or repetitive”, in order to feel like he “was doing something to keep the project going” (A.R., at p. 112).",

            "[5]                              The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed J.A.A.’s application to introduce fresh evidence, holding that Dr. Wood’s evidence, even if believed, could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result (2010 ONCA 491, 261 C.C.C. (3d) 125).  The majority added that the due diligence criterion, which the appellant essentially conceded he could not meet, “cannot be ignored or wished away” as it plays an important role in the administration of criminal justice (para. 34).  The majority also rejected the other grounds of appeal and upheld the convictions.  Winkler C.J.O., dissenting, would have allowed the application to introduce fresh evidence.  He would also have ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge improperly admitted lay opinion evidence on the bite mark and demeanour evidence of the complainant, and misdirected himself as to the manner in which he applied the criminal onus of proof.",

            "[24]                          Section 683(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , allows a Court of Appeal to receive fresh evidence when it is in the “interests of justice” to do so.  The four criteria for the admissibility of fresh evidence under this section of the Criminal Code  are set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.",
            "The interests of justice referred to in s. 683  of the Criminal Code  encompass not only an accused’s interest in having his or her guilt determined upon all of the available evidence, but also the integrity of the criminal process.  Finality and order are essential to that integrity.  The criminal justice system is arranged so that the trial will provide the opportunity to the parties to present their respective cases and the appeal will provide the opportunity to challenge the correctness of what happened at the trial.  Section 683(1)(d) of the Code recognizes that the appellate function can be expanded in exceptional cases, but it cannot be that the appellate process should be used routinely to augment the trial record.  Were it otherwise, the finality of the trial process would be lost and cases would be retried on appeal whenever more evidence was secured by a party prior to the hearing of the appeal.  For this reason, the exceptional nature of the admission of “fresh” evidence on appeal has been stressed . . . .",

Her mental condition was most marked and very convincing evidence thereof was given by both the cousin and the policeman.  I am of the opinion that such evidence could qualify as corroboration within the provisions of s. 142  of the Criminal Code .  The weight which should be given to such evidence was, of course, a matter for the jury and it must be presumed that the jurors did assess its weight in accordance with their sworn duty.",
            "[41]                          Murphy dealt with the now repealed s. 142  of the Criminal Code .  That section required a judge to warn a jury that it was unsafe to find the accused guilty in a rape case in the absence of corroborating evidence, if the only evidence implicating the accused was the testimony of the complainant.  This corroboration requirement no longer exists.  Nonetheless, the reasoning in Murphy still supports the use of post-event demeanour evidence as circumstantial evidence to support a complainant’s version of events.  If evidence of a sexual assault victim’s post-event demeanour was capable of being corroborative then, it is certainly capable of constituting relevant circumstantial evidence now.  In my respectful opinion, in this case, it was entirely appropriate for the judge to have regard to the demeanour evidence as part of all the evidence considered by him."

Murphy, nine witnesses testified.  The investigating officer made brief references to Mr. O’Brien’s prior criminal record and conduct in the course of his testimony.  Not only was there no objection to this evidence by the defence nor any request that it be limited to a narrative purpose; the defence used the evidence in its cross-examination of the investigating officer:",
            "[8]                              At the appeal, the Crown acknowledged that it was an error for the trial judge not to exclude the character evidence or qualify its purpose, but submitted that since it was not a serious error, the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal   Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.

            "[23]                          The trial judge let in the propensity evidence without comment and gave no hint in his reasons that he recognized that the police branding of the respondent as a career criminal was against basic principles of trial fairness.  Trial judges may be presumed to know the law but occasionally they misapply it.  Otherwise, there would be no need for appellate courts.",
            "[25]                          A majority of my colleagues conclude that the trial judge’s use of the word “entirely” in relation to his reliance on the DNA evidence is enough to render the unfairness of the trial harmless.  To do so, in my view, ignores the context of the trial as a whole.  The reliability of DNA science is well established, but problems in the handling of DNA samples and management of the test results have given rise to a number of wrongful convictions where (as here) there was not a shred of other probative evidence to connect an accused to the crime.  DNA evidence is not a sufficient substitute for a fair trial in the circumstances disclosed in this record.  The curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , requires the Crown, not the defence, to show that despite the unfair trial, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  For the reasons that follow, I do not believe that the Crown has discharged its onus.  I agree with the caution exercised by the majority in the court below.  I would dismiss the appeal.",

Blakeney that it is not just any random member of the community whose DNA has been found on the mask, but the DNA of a career criminal who was known to be implicated in a string of similar incidents in the same area around the same time.",
            "[32]                          Section 686(1)(b)(iii) permits an appellate court to uphold a conviction despite error of law committed by the trial judge where that error has not led to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The error of law in this case was the admission of the evidence portraying the respondent as a career criminal — exactly the sort of person one might expect robbed this convenience store."

            "[11]                          Writing for a majority of the Court of Appeal, Juriansz J.A. found that the trial judge erred by focusing on a brief portion of the ITO, failing to consider relevant evidence and misapprehending parts of the evidence.  In particular, the trial judge disregarded relevant evidence when she referred to Mr. Campbell’s criminal record as “unrelated” and when she discounted the evidence of the black bags.  Of the three tenants, only Mr. Campbell had been convicted of offences involving violence against women, and only Mr. Campbell had been linked to black bags.  Juriansz J.A. also found that there was no evidence to support the trial judge’s conclusion that the drafting of the ITO was “intentionally confusing or opaque” (para. 30).  To the extent that some of the statements in the summary section of the ITO were incorrect, they should have simply been excluded and the balance of the ITO assessed to determine whether there were sufficient grounds for the issuance of the search warrant.  Given the errors committed by the trial judge, the usual deference could not be afforded to her findings and it fell to the court to determine whether there was a basis upon which the warrant could issue.  Juriansz J.A. concluded that the cumulative effect of the compelling inference that the murder was committed in the townhouse and the evidence of Mr. Campbell’s criminal record, access and opportunity, and possession of black bags constituted reasonable grounds to issue the warrant to search Mr. Campbell’s room.",
            "[13]                          However, Doherty J.A. disagreed that the four areas of evidence relied upon by the majority constituted sufficient grounds to justify the issuance of the warrant with respect to Mr. Campbell’s room. In particular, he did not consider that the evidence of the black bags or contents of the garbage bags found with the deceased provided any support for the application for a warrant to search Mr. Campbell’s room.  Weighing the remaining pieces of evidence of Mr. Campbell’s criminal record and his opportunity and access against a hypothetical analogy involving a 100-unit apartment building, Doherty J.A. concluded that these two facts did not alone establish a basis to authorize a search of Mr. Campbell’s room.  Doherty J.A. would therefore have affirmed the trial judge’s finding that the search was unconstitutional and her ruling excluding the evidence."

[5]Although Noël’s post-operative progress was somewhat uneven, by March 13, 1998, he was doing well enough to be released from the hospital.  Dr. Joel Freeman, his surgeon, expected that Noël would make a full recovery.  Five days later, for reasons that are not entirely clear, he suddenly collapsed and died of a pulmonary thromboembolism (blood clot) that blocked the flow of blood to his lungs.  Dr. Freeman described the death as a “freakish” medical happening.  In the autopsy, trace amounts of cocaine were detected in Noël’s blood.  This presence of the drug indicated cocaine consumption within 30 to 45 minutes of death. [6]Expert testimony indicated that the blood clot was probably related to the injuries sustained in the shooting, but, given that cocaine could cause hypercoagulability (propensity to develop blood clots), the pathologist called by the Crown refused at trial to rule out the possibility that the clot wasentirelythe result of the victim’s consumption of cocaine.  On cross-examination, Dr. Brian Johnston testified:",

        "Facts": "A.Evidence at Trial [6]A detailed review of the evidence is required because, in my view, this appeal is largely fact-driven. [7]The facts giving rise to the murder charge against the appellant are straightforward and, for the most part, uncontested. [8]On January 7, 2004, the appellant, then age 20, shot and killed Jeffrey Shuckburgh, the owner of a local bar in the City of Calgary.  The murder weapon was a .22-calibre rifle that the appellant had stolen from his uncle’s farm a few weeks earlier.  At the time of the shooting, the appellant was cradling the barrel of the rifle in his left hand and had his right index finger poised to squeeze the trigger.  According to eyewitnesses, just before the gun went off, Mr. Shuckburgh was about five feet from the appellant, and the appellant was pointing the gun at Mr. Shuckburgh’s chest.  A single shot was fired.  It pierced Mr. Shuckburgh’s heart. [9]In the several weeks leading up to the shooting, the appellant had been living at the home of a friend, Michael Stewart, and Michael’s mother, Adina Stewart.  Before moving in with the Stewarts, the appellant had been hospitalized for a few days in December 2003 under a mental health warrant.  In her testimony, Ms. Stewart described the appellant as having “developmental disabilities”.  He was “a little awkward socially” and had “a difficult time obtaining and keeping jobs” (A.R., at p. 107). [10]As indicated, the murder weapon turned out to be a rifle the appellant had recently stolen from his uncle’s farm.  To avoid detection, the appellant had modified the rifle by cutting off its wooden stock.  He and his friend Michael Stewart fired the gun on a few occasions before the shooting incident.  The appellant concealed the weapon under his coat whenever he carried it in and out of the Stewart residence. [11]On the evening of the murder, the appellant and Michael Stewart consumed some beer at home and then headed to a nearby field to shoot the gun. Instead of going to the field, they decided to go to a local bar.  The appellant concealed the rifle under his coat so that he could take it inside. [12]While at the bar, the appellant consumed more beer.  He would later testify that his level of sobriety changed from “tipsy” to “more so, more drunk or intoxicated” over the course of the evening (A.R., at pp. 148 and 150). [13]A bartender noticed that the appellant was hiding something under his coat and confronted him.  The appellant denied the allegation but then said that he was concealing a “pellet gun” (A.R., at p. 153).  The appellant was told to leave the gun outside and he agreed to do so.  Upon his return, the appellant walked up to the bar and opened his coat to show that the gun was no longer there. [14]The appellant was asked to leave the bar a second time because the staff believed he was disturbing some female patrons.  The appellant protested but left without incident.  He retrieved his rifle and went to a local convenience store where he purchased and ate a hamburger. [15]Minutes later, he went back to the bar, allegedly in search of Michael Stewart.  This time, when he entered the bar, his demeanour was different.  He was pacing back and forth.  One witness said he seemed nervous.  Another testified he appeared “stunned” and had a “blank” look on his face (A.R., at p. 84).  The appellant readily admitted at trial that he was “nervous” when he returned to the bar for the third time (A.R., at p. 158): he knew that he was carrying the gun despite having been told that he was not allowed to have it in the bar. [16]A bartender noticed the appellant and escorted him out of the bar when he refused to leave.  Mr. Shuckburgh and another employee assisted with the removal.  In the process, the gun fell from the appellant’s coat as he crossed the doorway.  The appellant grabbed the gun with both hands.  Cradling the barrel in his left hand and placing his right hand around the trigger at waist level, he pointed the rifle at Mr. Shuckburgh and the two employees.  He slowly started backing down a ramp towards the street, while the bar personnel kept advancing toward him, telling him to“get out of here” (A.R., at p. 40).The appellant later testified that he was not planning to use the rifle: he just wanted to scare the three men who were after him. He said he was getting increasingly “nervous” and “more scared” and worried that Mr. Shuckburgh might find out where he lived and hurt him (A.R., at p. 168). [17]According to the two employees who were with Mr. Shuckburgh, the confrontation seemed over when the appellant suddenly started advancing back up the ramp towards them. At one point, the appellant rested his rifle on the top of a wall, sniper-style, turned it at one of the employees and said “stern[ly]”:  “This isn’t just a BB gun” (A.R., at p. 40).  The appellant later testified that he did so in order to scare the bar staff. [18]As the appellant eventually started moving back towards the bottom of the ramp, Mr. Shuckburgh continued to walk towards him.  By this time, the two other bar employees had fallen back, leaving Mr. Shuckburgh in front facing the appellant.  One of the two employees testified that the appellant would not step back unless Mr. Shuckburgh took a step forward. [19]The appellant testified that as he moved off the ramp onto a sidewalk, Mr. Shuckburgh began to walk faster towards him.  In turn, the appellant stepped back faster.  The next thing he knew, the gun “went up . . . and it went off” (A.R., at p. 177).  When asked at trial if he intended for the gun to come up, the appellant replied:  “I don’t know. I don’t think so.”  Asked to explain what happened, he said: “I don’t know. . . . stupid thing went off” (A.R., at p. 178).  The appellant testified that his finger pulled the trigger, but that he did not mean for the gun to go off and did not want to shoot anyone. [20]Mr. Shuckburgh was about five feet away from the appellant when the gun went off.  The bullet pierced Mr. Shuckburgh’s heart.  The wound proved to be fatal. [21]After the shooting, the appellant ran to the Stewarts’ residence.  Ms. Stewart testified that the appellant told her that he had pulled out the gun, pointed it at the man who was advancing towards him and asked the man to leave him alone.  As the man kept advancing, the appellant told Ms. Stewart that he panicked: “Something went crazy in my head at that point”, and he pulled the trigger (A.R., at p. 100). [22]According to Ms. Stewart, the appellant initially seemed “dazed” but grew more agitated as he recounted the events that had led to the shooting (A.R., at p. 100).  He took out the gun he had been hiding under his coat and began gesturing and waving the muzzle of the gun back and forth.  Ms. Stewart testified that the appellant seemed “very upset and very frightened” about what he had done (A.R., at p. 110).  At one point, according to Ms. Stewart, the appellant said that “he wanted to kill himself, that he did not want to deal with what the consequences were of this . . . [to] spend years in jail and so on, so he would rather kill himself” (A.R., at p. 104). [23]The police arrived quickly.  They found the appellant outside of the Stewart home.  He was non-responsive and appeared emotionless.  He ignored commands to drop the gun and lie down on the ground and, with a “blank” look on his face, started walking backwards to the house while holding the gun in his right hand (A.R., at p. 116).  Ultimately, he had to be tackled. [24]One of the police officers testified that it was apparent that the appellant had been drinking but he was not staggering or slurring his speech.  He appeared to understand what was going on around him.  In the officer’s view, the appellant was not impaired. [25]At the station, having been arrested for murder, the appellant told an officer that he “didn’t mean to kill [Mr. Shuckburgh] (pause) on purpose” and that he “didn’t mean to shoot anybody” (R.R., at p. 87).  He also made suicidal statements and asked an officer to shoot him or to give him his service revolver so that he could shoot himself. B.The Position of the Defence at Trial [26]The defence conceded at trial that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter. The only live issue at trial, according to defence counsel, was the appellant’s intent when he pulled the trigger.  As defence counsel explained in his closing submissions: The theory put forwardbythe defence is this: that Adrian Walle, on the night in question, in a nervous, shaky, highly agitated state, at a time when he consumed a certain amount of alcohol, and while being almost continually pursued and advanced upon by a numerically superior force, unintentionally discharged that .22 [rifle] at a time when it was pointed at Jeffrey Shuckburgh.  [A.R., at pp. 198-99] [27]In urging the trial judge to find that the discharge of the gun was unintentional, defence counsel said that “Mr. Walle, at the time when his finger pressed that trigger, did not mean to pull that trigger” (A.R., at p. 212).  In response to a question from the trial judge, defence counsel clarified his position as follows:",

Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, raises the question of when an HIV-positive person’s failure to disclose the condition to a sexual partner amounts to fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.

        "Facts": "[4]D.C. learned that she was HIV-positive in 1991, after the death of her partner.  She was treated with antiretrovirals, resulting in the undetectability of her viral load.  In July of 2000, she met the complainant at a soccer match in which their sons were playing. In time, their relationship became intimate.  Depending on whose account is believed, they had sex on one or more occasions before D.C. disclosed her HIV status to the complainant.  And depending on who was believed, a condom was or was not used; the complainant said no condom was used; D.C. said a condom was used. [5]Upon learning that D.C. had HIV, the complainant broke off the relationship, but renewed it of his own initiative a few weeks later.  They moved in together and lived as a family for four years. During this time, they had protected and unprotected sexual relations.  The complainant has never contracted HIV. [6]In December 2004, D.C., who had been briefly hospitalized, decided to end the relationship. She asked the complainant to leave the house.  He refused.  A few days later, D.C., accompanied by her son, went to the family home to remove her belongings.  The encounter was violent.  The complainant assaulted D.C. and her son.  He was charged and convicted of assault. [7]On February 11, 2005, the complainant filed complaints with the police. The Crown laid charges of sexual assault and aggravated assault against D.C., on the ground that when the complainant and D.C. first had sex four years earlier, D.C. had not disclosed the fact that she was HIV-positive.",

        "Facts": "A.Overview of the Facts [6]On May 21, 2007, users of the washroom at a Wal-Mart store discovered a puddle of blood on the floor of one of the stalls and heard the sounds of a young woman who we know now to have been the respondent struggling inside. The customers alerted the store staff, but when an assistant manager asked the young woman if she was all right, she responded from inside the stall that she was fine. [7]Shortly thereafter, a customer reported that she had discovered a baby’s arm sticking out of the toilet bowl of the stall where the young woman had been. Other customers had seen the baby by that point, but all of them thought it was dead. When the store manager went into the bathroom to see what was happening, he observed that the baby’s leg had started twitching. He pulled the baby out of the toilet. An emergency response team was called and the baby, A.J.H., was transported to the hospital where he was successfully resuscitated and found to be completely healthy. [8]Police gave video surveillance tapes of the store to various media outlets and the respondent was eventually identified as the woman seen entering and leaving the washroom at the time in question. When contacted by police, she cooperated fully and confirmed that she was the mother of the child. She was charged with unlawfully abandoning a child under the age of 10 years and thereby endangering his life contrary tos. 218of theCode. [9]At her trial, the respondent testified. She was 22 years of age by that time and was living with her boyfriend and their baby, S.K. Prior to the birth of A.J.H., she had been gaining weight and so she had taken three home pregnancy tests, all of which were negative. She did not believe she was pregnant because she had been getting her period every month prior to the birth. When she arrived at the Wal-Mart store, she was not feeling well and so she went to the bathroom, where she gave birth a minute or two later. She was surprised by the birth. She did not try to pick the baby up because it was all blue and she thought it was dead. She did not respond to offers for help or tell anyone what had happened because she was afraid. She tried to clean up the blood on the floor and then returned to her friend’s car. [10]When she heard the police were looking for her, the respondent told her mother she was the one that had given birth to the baby in the store. When she found out the baby was alive, she was eager to see him. He now lives with the respondent’s mother and the respondent visits him almost every day. A.D.H. testified that it took her five or six months to realize that she was pregnant with her second child, S.K. B.Court of Queen’s Bench, 2009 SKQB 261, 335 Sask. R. 173 (Gabrielson J.) [11]The trial judge noted that the respondent acknowledged that she had left her child in the toilet at the Wal-Mart store, thereby committing theactus reusof the s. 218 offence.  As for the fault element, the trial judge decided that subjective fault was required. He therefore expressed the issue he had to decide as follows: “. . . whether the accused . . . intended to abandon the child, A.J.H., or did so recklessly with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances or was wilfully blind in respect to them” (para. 15). [12]The trial judge answered this question in the negative and found that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent intended to abandon her child (paras. 23-26). The accused had been credible in her testimony. She had not known she was pregnant and truly believed she had delivered a dead child. Her fear and confusion explained her subsequent behaviour. The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Dr. Simpson, who testified that, “[u]nder these circumstances of an unknown pregnancy and a premature, precipitous birth, it is understandable that the accused thought the child was not alive and that she would be scared or panicked, not request help and immediately leave the scene of the birth” (para. 24). Thus, the trial judge found the respondent not guilty and dismissed the charge (para. 26). C.Court of Appeal, 2011 SKCA 6, 366 Sask. R. 123 (Richards, Smith and Ottenbreit JJ.A.) [13]Richards J.A. (Smith J.A. concurring) agreed with the trial judge thats. 218of theCoderequires subjective fault.He supported his conclusion with a detailed analysis of the text and context of the provision.  On the other hand, Ottenbreit J.A. concluded that s. 218 only requires an objective fault element, but that an honest and reasonable mistake of fact could be a defence.  He found that the respondent had acted on the basis of the mistaken but reasonable belief that her child was dead and concluded that the trial judge’s verdict of acquittal should be upheld on that basis.",

According to Kirkpatrick J.A., because individual jurors may have reached their decisions on the verdict by different routes, it could not be said that the only rational explanation for the verdict of acquittal was that the jury found that the Hells Angels was not a criminal organization (para. 85). Nor did the nature and timing of the jury’s question, or the sentencing judge’s reasons, support a conclusion by a court in a subsequent proceeding that the issue of whether the Hells Angels was a criminal organization had necessarily been resolved by the jury.

            "[7]                              In Mahalingan, this Court had to decide whether the doctrine of issue estoppel should be retained as part of Canadian criminal law. A majority of the Court favoured retaining it in the criminal law, but in a narrow form. Not all issues raised in a previous trial can be the subject of issue estoppel. Rather, the Crown is precluded from relitigating only those issues that were decided in favour of the accused at the earlier trial (paras. 22, 31 and 33). Moreover, the resolution of an issue in favour of the accused must be “a necessary inference from the trial judge’s findings or from the fact of the acquittal” (para. 52).",
            "[9]                              I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that Leask J. erred in law in drawing inferences on a balance of probabilities — a question of burden of proof — rather than considering whether a finding regarding the criminal nature of the organization was logically necessary to the acquittal — a question of logic and law.",

        "Facts": "[110]We are concerned in this case with particular investigative techniques that may be authorized under theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, in the context of the police wishing to have lawful access to the content of text messages. Before turning to an analysis of the specific legal issues we confront, I will set out some technical background about text messaging and the range of investigative techniques that may be open to the police to gain access to them.  I will then set out a brief account of the proceedings which bring the case to us and the specific issues that we must resolve. A.Telus’s Text Messaging Service [111]Text messaging, technically known as Short Message Service (“SMS”), is a communication service using standardized communications protocols and mobile telephone service networks to allow for the exchange of short text messages from one mobile phone to another. [112]Telus’s system of text message delivery is the same as that of other telecommunications service providers. When a message is sent by a Telus subscriber, it is transmitted to a Telus cell tower and then routed to a Mobile Switching Centre (“MSC”) which is the computerized mainframe to the Telus network. Within the MSC is Telus’s Short Message Service Centre (“SMSC”), which uses routing engines to attempt to deliver the message to its destination. If the recipient is also a Telus subscriber, the message will then be sent from Telus’s SMSC to a cell tower which will forward the message to the recipient’s phone. If the recipient is not a Telus subscriber, the message will pass from Telus’s SMSC to the SMSC of the recipient’s provider and then through a cell tower to the recipient’s phone. Where the destination phone is not available (for example, because it is turned off or does not have service reception), the text message remains in the Telus SMSC for up to five days. If the recipient phone does not become available within that timeframe, the message is deleted. The sender is not informed if a message is not delivered. [113]Telus differs from most other providers in that it makes electronic copies of the text messages that pass through its system and stores those copies in one of four computer databases for at least 30 days. There are three PSMS databases (namely, PSMS 1 (primary database), PSMS 2 (secondary database), and PSMS 3 (tertiary database)) which receive messages within up to approximately 15 minutes of the time they are sent. Which PSMS a message goes to depends on the capacity of each database. All text messages received by a Telus customer are copied, and the copy is forwarded to the databases when the Telus subscriber’s phone receives the message from the Telus SMSC. When a Telus subscriber sends a text message, it is copied when it arrives at the Telus SMSC and the copy is stored in a database. Telus also maintains a fourth database, named PECSMS, which receives messages between two to eight hours after they are sent. At the time this case was heard at first instance, Telus expected that by April 2011, PECSMS would be the sole repository for all text message content; it would cease to use the PSMS databases. [114]Telus copies text messages in order to facilitate troubleshooting and dealing with customer complaints. As I will explain, Telus in doing this is intercepting the messages and it has legal authority under theCodeto do so without a wiretap authorization. In my view, Telus’s stated purpose, coupled with the fact that most other service providers in Ontario transmit text messages without storing copies of them in this manner, makes it clear that this additional step is not part of the communications process.   Unlike e-mail messages, which must go through transient storage as they are transmitted, storage of the type in issue here is not inherent to the communication of text messages. B.Text Messages and Investigative Techniques [115]TheCodeprovides at least three potential ways for the police to obtain authorization to acquire the content of stored text messages from Telus: a production order, a general warrant and a so-called “wiretap” interception authorization. The police in this case sought and obtained a general warrant as a sort of enhanced production order, but Telus’s contention is that they were required to seek a wiretap authorization. It will be helpful to describe these three investigative techniques briefly, because the requirements of each are somewhat interrelated.",

        ],
        "Facts": "A.Facts [4]The respondent, Nicole Ryan, has been the victim of a violent, abusive and controlling husband.  She believed that he would cause her and their daughter serious bodily harm or death as he had threatened to do many times. [5]In September of 2007, she began to think about having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day. The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man”. Shortly after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an offence not committed contrary tos. 464(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. [6]At trial, there was no issue that the elements of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was), indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been established. He based this conclusion on the respondent’s admission that the Crown had proved aprima faciecase and on the audio and video tapes of recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on arrest (trial judge’s reasons, at paras. 4-6). The only issue at trial was whether the respondent’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied. The Crown argued thaton the facts of this case, the components of duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on appeal, that the defence of duress was not availablein lawto the respondent (transcript, at pp. 22-23; trial judgment, 2010 NSSC 114 (CanLII), at paras. 7-8). [7]The trial judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that the relationship and the events she had described relating to that relationship were true. For example, Mr. Ryan’s violent and threatening behaviour included outbursts at least once a week, where he would throw things at the respondent’s head, physically assault her and threaten to kill her (trial judgment, at para. 17).  The respondent testified that Mr. Ryan often told her that he would kill her and their daughter if she ever tried to leave him (para. 33), and that he would “burn the fucking house down” while she and her daughter were inside (para. 45). [8]The trial judge had no difficulty in concluding that Mr. Ryan was a manipulative, controlling and abusive husband who sought to control the actions of the respondent, be they social, familial or marital. The judge found that the respondent’s sole reason for her actions was her fear of her husband which arose from his threats of death and serious bodily harm to herself and their daughter (paras. 149-52). He also was satisfied that the respondent had led evidence to the requisite standard that she reasonably believed that Mr. Ryan would cause her and her daughter serious bodily injury and that there was no safe avenue of escape other than having him killed. [9]The judge concluded that the respondent was in a very vulnerable state, had lost a considerable amount of weight, was dissociated and despondent. She had an intense and reasonable fear of Mr. Ryan, was feeling helpless, felt she had lost control and felt she was threatened with annihilation. While she had engaged the police and other agencies in an effort to assist her in the past, the evidence was that her problems were viewed as a “civil matter”.  She felt so vulnerable that the phone call of the undercover police officer appeared to her as the solution to all her problems (para. 73). On the basis of these findings, the trial judge found that the common law defence of duress applied, and acquitted the accused. [10]The Crown appealed but the Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the trial judge’s verdict of acquittal. On the appeal, for the first time, the Crown took the position that duress was not available in law as a defence to the respondent on these facts. Duress, the Crown contended, applies only when an accused is forced by threats to commit an offence against a third party (2011 NSCA 30, 301 N.S.R. (2d) 255, at para. 56). MacDonald C.J.N.S. (Saunders and Oland JJ.A. concurring) rejected the Crown’s submission. Simply put, the Court of Appeal found that the focus of the defence of duress is to absolve an accused of criminal liability when his or her conduct is morally involuntary. Therefore, the analysis should focus on the accused’s predicament and not on who did what to whom in who’s presence. It followed that the respondent should not be denied the defence of duress simply because the victim was not a third party, but the aggressor. The court saw no principled basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a third party being the targeted victim. [11]The court reviewed the case law in this area which emphasizes the need for triers of fact to fully understand the plight of battered spouses who, having reacted to threats from their abusive partners, rely on the defence of duress. MacDonald C.J.N.S. also highlighted the need for the defence to be sufficiently flexible, when appropriate, to accommodate the dark reality of spousal abuse.",

        "Facts": "[14]Having concluded that party liability was available, Rosenberg J.A. reviewed the instructions on party liability and found them to be deficient.  In his view, they “were generic, divorced from the facts of the case and failed to make clear that the jury had to find that the appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his assistance was intended to assist [R and T] in pursuing the unlawful object of murdering their mother” (para. 29). [15]Despite this deficiency, Rosenberg J.A. was satisfied that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of theCodecould safely be applied to uphold the conviction.  In this regard, he observed that the defence put forward by the appellant — his comments in the MSNchats to T were not to be taken seriously — “did not depend on whether the appellant was a principal in, or a party to, the conspiracy”.  If the jury accepted his position or it raised a reasonable doubt, he would be acquitted.  On the other hand, if the jury rejected his position, “a finding of guilt was inevitable”.  Rosenberg J.A. further noted that the appellant’s MSN chats with T constituted “direct evidence, in his own words, of the appellant’s role in the conspiracy”.  It followed, in his view, that the “[appellant’s] liability as a party or a member of the conspiracy was overwhelming” (para. 74).",

        "Facts": "[4]The facts of this case reveal a set of circumstances, as dramatic as they were tragic, that engendered the despair that ultimately led to the murder of three young children. [5]Before I discuss the questions of law raised by this appeal, a brief review of the facts is therefore in order. [6]The appellant met Marc Laliberté in 2000 and decided to move in with him in Chibougamau with her daughter Joëlle from a previous union.  The couple had two other children:  Marc‑Ange, born in 2001, and Louis‑Philippe, born in 2004.  They moved to Amos in 2002.  Misfortune seemed to dog the family.  The appellant was sexually assaulted, and this caused her considerable emotional distress as a result of which she was unable to leave the family home for very long.  Marc Laliberté lost his mother and fell into a deep depression.  Hoping for better luck, the family left Amos for Saguenay, where Kathie Ouellet, a childhood friend of the appellant’s, lived.  Marc Laliberté sold the family home and quit his job, and the family settled into their new surroundings.  However, their new life got off to a rough start. [7]Once in Saguenay, Marc Laliberté had difficulty finding a stable job and resigned himself to receiving employment insurance benefits.  Meanwhile, the appellant was unable to hold on to the few short‑term jobs she was able to find.  In short, the couple encountered ever greater financial difficulties, and were forced to make an assignment in bankruptcy in October 2008. [8]The holiday season was drawing near.  On Christmas Eve, despite their bad luck, the couple decided to give the children the chance to enjoy this “festive” period.  Marc Laliberté refused to pay the rent for December, and used the money so saved to buy numerous gifts for the children and for friends. [9]On December 27, 2008, the appellant renewed her and her spouse’s prescriptions for oxazepam, a soporific drug used to treat anxiety attacks, giving false reasons for doing so early.  She told the pharmacist that her spouse was going through a difficult period and that they were about to go on a trip.  While at the drug store, she also purchased some children’s Gravol.  That same day, the family went to Normandin to visit members of Marc Laliberté’s family for a few hours. [10]On December 28, 2008, the appellant sent an e‑mail message entitled [translation]“a miracle, please” to the Fondation maman Dion in which, after recounting the family’s difficulties, she asked for help.  She wrote: “. . . I would like a miracle for Dec. 31, 2008”. [11]The evening of December 29, she visited her friend Kathie Ouellet and told her that she did not know what she would do with her children if her spouse was not there.  The next day, the appellant gave her nicest clothes to Ms. Ouellet. [12]On December 31, according to the appellant, her spouse spent the morning working on the computer, and he turned the screen off every time she came near.  Around noon, he joined her in the kitchen.  He told her that he had made a decision and that the whole family would be leaving together.  He then dictated some documents to her that she wrote down like a robot, she said, after which she had no memory of what was in them.  Marc Laliberté then left the house.  According to the appellant, it was then that she noticed some papers left on the kitchen counter, and after reading them, she realized what was going on.  When her spouse returned in the afternoon, she told him she did not agree with the murder‑suicide pact, and she tore up the documents.  She claimed to have understood from the expression on her spouse’s face that he had resigned himself to abandoning the dark plan. [13]The appellant testified that the rest of the day was uneventful.  That evening, as planned, the family sat down in front of the television to watch a movie together.  Marc Laliberté prepared some drinks and popcorn for all the family.  Shortly after that, the appellant noticed that one of the boys had fallen asleep, and then she too fell asleep.  She said she had not suspected that their drinks had been poisoned. [14]The physical evidence that was filed included two torn‑up documents that had been found in the garbage can:  a handwritten joint will, in the appellant’s hand, and a document prepared on the computer by Marc Laliberté in which he told his life’s story.  Another copy of the will, typed out and signed by both spouses, was found on the kitchen island.  Three handwritten letters from Cathie Gauthier to her friend Kathie Ouellet, to her biological mother and to her last employer completed the evidence.  All these letters mentioned that the couple had decided together to end their and their children’s lives.  Some empty medicine bottles, as well as the prescriptions for oxazepam and the drug store’s sales slip dated December 27, 2008, were also found in the kitchen. [15]During the evening of January 1, 2009, the appellant called the emergency services number, asked for an ambulance and told the operator that her left wrist was slit, saying that [translation]“it was a pact, my husband killed our three children”, and adding that“we told ourselves we wouldn’t start 2009, but . . .”. [16]When first responders arrived on the scene, they found the appellant with an injured wrist and pronounced her spouse and their three children dead.  The evidence shows that the children were poisoned with Gravol and oxazepam.  Traces of oxazepam were also detected in the appellant, whose left wrist had allegedly been slit by her spouse, Marc Laliberté.",

        ],
        "Facts": "A.Overview of the Facts [4]The respondent was charged with sexual assault of and sexual interference with his niece when she was between the ages of 12 and 14. The jury found the respondent guilty. The trial judge entered a conviction for sexual assault but stayed the sexual interference count because it was based on the same factual and legal foundation:  seeKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729;R. v. S.J.M., 2009 ONCA 244, 247 O.A.C. 178. The background as it emerged at trial is this. [5]The complainant’s parents separated when she was nine years old. Her mother moved to Ontario while she continued to live with her father in a small town in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Their home was next door to the respondent and his wife, who is her father’s sister. When her father was away for work, the respondent and his wife were responsible for her care and even when her father was home, they would regularly all have supper together. [6]The complainant testified that she was prompted to disclose the respondent’s conduct towards her by an incident in June 2008.  She had missed the school bus and asked the respondent to drive her to school.  During the drive, the respondent began to talk to her about sex and said, “all you have to do is say the word and I’ll make love to you”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 47.  Later that day or the next day, the complainant called her mother in Ontario and told her about this incident. She then flew to Ontario to be with her mother.  Her mother took her to a doctor who made a referral to child protection authorities which in turn led to police involvement. In late July, her mother accompanied her to the Port Elgin police station to make an initial videotaped statement in which she described one incident. [7]At trial, the respondent also testified about an incident in June.  He agreed to drive the complainant to school after she missed her bus.  He testified that he spoke to her about being careful not to become pregnant, a conversation he said was prompted by MSN blog messages she had written using his computer and the respondent’s concern about the sexual nature of the messages and her use of alcohol.  According to the respondent, the complainant did not want to talk about it and when she got out of the car, told him it was none of his business and slammed the car door.  The respondent did not tell his wife or the complainant’s father about his concerns or about the door-slamming incident. [8]RCMP officers in Newfoundland became involved in the investigation in late July 2008.  RCMP Constable Paul Hierlihy reviewed the initial videotaped statement from Ontario but was not satisfied with the way the interview had been conducted. He therefore arranged for RCMP Constable Lisa Norman, who had received training in interviewing child victims of sexual abuse, to re-interview the complainant in Ontario. [9]Cst. Norman testified that the complainant’s initial statement to Port Elgin police was conducted in the police station, with four persons present (the interviewing male police officer, a social worker, the complainant and her mother). In Cst. Norman’s experience, interviewing an alleged child victim of sexual assault in the presence of her mother is not always helpful because it is not a topic that children are comfortable talking about.  She saw no need for the presence of a social worker and noted that “sometimes it helps talking to a female” officer: A.R., vol. I, at p. 196. She agreed with Cst. Hierlihy’s assessment that the original statement was vague and had a lot of “I don’t remembers” and, in her view, there was not a good rapport between the interviewing officer and the complainant who appeared not to have been comfortable at that time. [10]In November 2008, Cst. Norman conducted her interview one-on-one with the complainant in a private hotel conference room, in order to avoid the police station which is sometimes “intimidating”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 197. During this interview, the complainant described more incidents than she had in her initial statement. When Cst. Norman asked her about this, the complainant told her that she had not felt comfortable with the male officer and that she had not wanted to talk about it in front of her mother. [11]At trial, the complainant testified about several sexual incidents involving the respondent. Her evidence was that one incident occurred in the respondent’s car, when he placed his hand between the complainant’s legs and touched her vagina; another in the computer room in the respondent’s home when he placed his hand on her left breast over her clothing; and another in the kitchen of the respondent’s home while the respondent’s wife was present in the room when the respondent touched the complainant’s breast over her clothing. The complainant also referred to an occasion on which the respondent had asked her if she was mad at him, and said, “You know I love you and I wouldn’t do anything to you like that”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 45. But she could not remember why he had said that. [12]The respondent testified in his own defence and denied any sexual activity with the complainant. The respondent’s wife echoed the respondent’s testimony. The respondent’s brother and nephew testified that the complainant was quite affectionate towards the respondent, that she seemed comfortable when she was around him and, generally, that the respondent and the complainant seemed to enjoy a good relationship. B.The Trial Judge’s Instructions to the Jury [13]The parties agree that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury were error-free.  She gave the usual instructions with respect to credibility and truthfulness generally, including the direction that the jury could believe or disbelieve all or parts of anything a witness said in the witness box. She specifically addressed the young age of the victim and instructed the jury that they could consider this factor along with lapse of time in dealing with minor discrepancies in the complainant’s testimony. She however specified that lying under oath was serious and could taint the entire testimony of a witness. The trial judge stressed the fact that this case was about credibility and noted that there was no other direct evidence supporting the complainant’s allegations. She gave a thorough summary of the evidence of the complainant and the respondent and clearly drew the jury’s attention to the inconsistencies between the complainant’s testimony and that of other witnesses and her own previous statements. [14]The trial judge directed the jury that it was “essential that the credibility and reliability of [the complainant’s] evidence be tested in the light of all the other evidence”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 69.  She reviewed in detail the position of the defence that the complainant was not telling the truth, referring to several points at which her recollections were not consistent. The trial judge also noted that the defence theory was that the complainant lied because she wanted her mother to return to Newfoundland so that they could live together. She also reviewed in detail the position of the Crown, noting that the motive to lie alleged by the defence was never put to the complainant directly and further that her evidence was that she could have left Newfoundland to live with her mother at any time. [15]The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. C.The Judgment of the Court of Appeal, 2011 NLCA 59, 312 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 12 (per Barry J.A., Wells and White JJ.A. Concurring) [16]The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and acquitted the respondent.  The court stated that in conducting a review for unreasonableness, “the appellate court draws its own inference from the evidence admitted at trial as to the reasoning process of the jury and determines whether this could have been logical or rational in light of the verdict being reviewed. . . . If no reasonable process of analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the case, an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have acted judicially in convicting”:  paras. 47 and 52. [17]After reviewing the record, the court concluded that the verdict was unreasonable because “[a]n experienced judge sitting alone, with the evidence presented in this case, would not be able to provide adequate reasons to explain how he or she could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt in light of the credibility concerns arising from the unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities arising from the complainant’s testimony and statements”: para. 75. [18]The Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and statements, even taking into account “all explanations given by her for those inconsistencies”: para. 64. [19]First, the Court of Appeal was concerned by inconsistencies regarding the number and nature of the incidents between the complainant’s trial evidence and her initial disclosure. The complainant described only a single and different incident to her mother, father and to the male police officer when she first came forward. As noted earlier, when the complainant later spoke to a female police officer, she described more incidents as she did at trial. The court noted that the complainant said that she felt more comfortable speaking alone to the female RCMP constable and wanted to avoid the embarrassment of speaking in the presence of her mother.  However, the court reasoned that “[d]iscomfort and embarrassment may help explain omitted incidents [but] they do not adequately explain her express denial that any other incidents had occurred”: para. 66. The court was also concerned that the complainant “contradicted herself somewhat in her explanation in that at the preliminary inquiry she had said her memory had improved between the first and second police interviews while at trial she said she had deliberately decided not to discuss all incidents”: para. 66. [20]A second matter referred to by the Court of Appeal as creating a “serious concern about [the complainant’s] truthfulness overall” (para. 67) was this: the complainant told the male police officer at the initial interview that the only incident happened in the respondent’s home and nowhere else. But she testified at trial that the most serious incident happened in the respondent’s vehicle. She explained this inconsistency by saying that she felt discomfort speaking to a male police officer in her mother’s presence. With regard to the complainant’s explanation of this inconsistency, the Court of Appeal indicated that “discomfort would go somewhat towards explaining omissions but does not adequately explain her express denial of other locations”: para. 67. [21]A further point which troubled the Court of Appeal was the fact that in her initial statement to the male police officer, the complainant had said that the respondent had been alone in the house when she had been assaulted, while she later said that the respondent’s wife had been present on one occasion in the same room and that the respondent’s wife and the complainant’s father had been present on another occasion in a different room but within hearing range.  This unexplained discrepancy left the Court of Appeal with “an additional question regarding her credibility”: para. 68. [22]The Court of Appeal also found that various inconsistencies regarding the complainant’s nervousness about being alone around the respondent raised “significant concerns about her credibility”: para. 71. These included: the complainant’s father’s denial of the complainant’s testimony that she had told him she did not want to go to her uncle’s home; the complainant’s willingness to continue having interactions with the respondent even after the incidents; and the fact that the complainant declared at the preliminary inquiry that she was not afraid to be alone with her uncle in his car yet she had told police in a prior statement that she was “frightened to death” to drive alone with him: para. 70. [23]In the Court of Appeal’s view, the complainant’s inability to give any detail regarding the nature of the other incident which she vaguely recalled added “some slight additional doubt regarding her credibility”: para. 73. [24]The Court of Appeal concluded that by virtue of these “unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities alone, the credibility of the complainant was damaged to the extent that it is questionable whether a jury acting judicially could reasonably have convicted”: para. 74. The court noted that in addition, a jury acting judicially has to consider the complainant’s testimony in the context of the respondent’s denial of all her allegations.  In the court’s view, “[n]othing appears from the transcript which should have caused a juror to question his truthfulness”: para. 74. In light of the complainant’s testimony and the apparently plausible denial of the accused, the court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict. The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury could not have been acting judicially in reaching a guilty verdict and that the verdict was therefore unreasonable.",

[57]The Crown must also demonstrate that an accusedknowinglydealt with a criminal organization.  The stigma associated with the offence requires that the accused have a subjectivemens reawith respect to his or her association with the organization (seeLindsay(2004 S.C.J.), at para. 64). [58]There is ample evidence that Venneri knew that Dauphin was operating a large drug-trafficking organization ― or made himself wilfully blind to that obvious fact.  And the evidence leaves no room for doubt as to the required nexus between Dauphin’s organization and the offence of trafficking committed by Venneri.  The organization received a direct benefit from the commission of the offence. [59]This was particularly evident after the 2005 seizures of cocaine when, as noted by the trial judge, Venneri became [translation] “an important pillar” in terms of supply.  The evidence establishes that Dauphin was unable to secure cocaine without the assistance of Venneri.  Manifestly, Venneri trafficked “in association with” the organization when he secured for it a source of supply following the 2005 seizures. VI [60]For all of these reasons, as stated at the outset, I would allow the appeal for the sole purpose of setting aside Venneri’s acquittal on count 3, and otherwise affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

            "[5]                              Mr. Boudreault was arrested and charged with having care or control of a motor vehicle (1) while his ability was impaired by alcohol and (2) with more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of his blood, contrary to ss. 253(1) (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .",
            "[7]                              We are required on this appeal to settle an issue of law that divided the courts below — and has divided other courts across the country as well.  And we are required to then determine whether the trial judge, in acquitting Mr. Boudreault, committed an error of “law alone”, within the meaning of s. 676(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  If he did not, the Crown had no right of appeal against his acquittals, however surprising — even unreasonable — we may find that judgment to be: R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 32.",
            "[8]                              Essentially, then, the appeal raises two distinct issues of law — the first of general application, the second of particular application here.  Set out interrogatively, these issues can be framed this way: Is risk of danger an essential element of the offence of care or control under s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code ?  And, if it is, did the trial judge in this case err in law in finding that there was no such risk in the present circumstances?",
            "[9]                              For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that “care or control”, within the meaning of s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code , signifies (1) an intentional course of conduct associated with a motor vehicle; (2) by a person whose ability to drive is impaired, or whose blood alcohol level exceeds the legal limit; (3) in circumstances that create a realistic risk, as opposed to a remote possibility, of danger to persons or property.",
            "[15]                          The judge’s conclusion on the facts, however surprising or unreasonable it may appear to another court, did not give rise to a question of law alone.  And, as I indicated earlier, this is the only ground upon which the Crown, pursuant to s. 676(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , can appeal the acquittal of an accused at trial.",
            "[25]                          I turn now to consider the issue of general application that concerns us here: Is risk of danger an essential element of the offence of care or control under s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code ?",
            "[33]                          In this light, I think it helpful to set out once again the essential elements of “care or control” under s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code  in this way:",
            "[35]                          To require that the risk be “realistic” is to establish a low threshold consistent with Parliament’s intention to prevent a danger to public safety. To require only that the risk be “theoretically possible” is to adopt too low a threshold since it would criminalize unnecessarily a broad range of benign and inconsequential conduct.",
            "[36]                          It is settled law that an intention to set the vehicle in motion is not an essential element of the offence: Ford v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 231.  This may appear anomalous in view of the presumption set out at s. 258(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , which provides that an accused who was found in the driver’s seat of a motor vehicle",
            "[39]                          Put differently, s. 258(1)(a)  indicates that proof of voluntary inebriation and voluntary occupancy of the driver’s seat do not by their coexistence alone conclusively establish “care or control” under s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code . Something more is required and, in my view, the “something more” is a realistic risk of danger to persons or property.",
            "[40]                          I agree with Justice Cromwell that Parliament’s purpose in enacting the care or control provision was preventive, and directed at the inherent danger that normally arises from the mere “combination of alcohol and automobile”: Saunders, at p. 290.  With respect, however, I believe this supports my view that Parliament’s intention in enacting s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code  was to criminalize only conduct that creates a realistic risk of danger.",
            "[49]                          The accused may escape conviction, for example, by adducing evidence that the motor vehicle was inoperable or, on account of its location or placement, could, under no reasonably conceivable circumstances, pose a risk of danger.  Likewise, use of the vehicle for a manifestly innocent purpose should not attract the stigma of a criminal conviction.  As Lamer C.J. observed in Penno, “The law . . . is not deprived of any flexibility and does not go so far as to punish the mere presence of an individual whose ability to drive is impaired in a motor vehicle” (p. 877).",
            "[54]                          The trial judge in this case committed no error of principle in outlining the applicable law.  He recognized that the absence of an intention to drive is not a defence and is only relevant to rebutting the presumption in s. 258(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  He also correctly noted that a risk of danger is an essential element of the offence.  Finally, the trial judge turned his mind to the possibility that the risk may materialize by setting the vehicle in motion, either intentionally or unintentionally.  In this latter regard, the trial judge recognized that the risk of [translation] “the vehicle being set in motion involuntarily” is a danger the offence is designed to prevent (para. 35).  He did not, however, expressly address that danger in this case.  This is hardly surprising: At no point during the trial did the Crown allude at all to any such risk in this case.",
            "[62]                          The appeal raises two issues:  first, did the trial judge err in law by finding that the risk of danger is an essential element of the care or control offence in s. 253(1)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and second, did he err in finding that there was no such risk here?"
        ],
        "Facts": "[87]I would emphasize that to give the expression “care or control” its normal meaning does not result in an offence of strict liability.  There can be no care or control where, as for example inToews, there are no acts of care or control by the accused. The issue of whether an accused, whose only acts in relation to the vehicle occurred while it was inoperable, can be said to be in care or control has not been resolved by this Court;Saunderssimply held that an inoperable motor vehicle was nonetheless a motor vehicle within the definition then contained in theCriminal Code. In this case the vehicle was operable and I would leave the issue of care or control in the case of an inoperable vehicle to another day when the point is both pertinent and fully argued. [88]I conclude that the trial judge erred in law by holding that the risk of danger was an essential element of the offence. B.Did the Trial Judge Err in Finding That There Was no Risk Here? [89]Even if, contrary to my view, risk is an essential element of the offence, I would uphold the Court of Appeal’s decision to reverse the acquittals entered by the trial judge. The trial judge erred in law in holding that there was no risk of putting the vehicle in motion since the accused did not have the intention to do so. Although the trial judge correctly noted at para. 38 of his reasons that the absence of intention to put the vehicle in motion did not constitute a defence for the accused, he in effect made it so. He held that there was no riskbecausethe accused did not intend to drive:",

        "Facts": "A.Overview of the Facts [3]In June of 2009, the respondent Stéphane McRae was detained awaiting trial on several charges relating to trafficking in narcotics. For a time, Louis-Joseph Comeau, Édouard Collin, and Patrick Cloutier were also detained at the same detention centre.  The respondent introduced Mr. Comeau to Mr. Cloutier as his [translation] “contract killer”.  At times, Mr. Cloutier passed on messages from Mr. Comeau to the respondent. [4]Based on the statements of Édouard Collin and Patrick Cloutier, various charges of uttering threats were laid against the respondent and Mr. Comeau. Mr. Comeau was convicted of uttering threats in a separate trial (R. v. Comeau, 2010 QCCQ 20939 (CanLII)). At issue on this appeal are five counts of knowingly conveying to Patrick Cloutier and Édouard Collin, at various times between June 1, 2009, and September 5, 2009, threats to cause death or bodily harm, contrary tos. 264.1(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to: theCrownprosecutor; an officer-investigator; and four witnesses involved in the case being brought against the respondent and Mr. Comeau for trafficking narcotics. [5]At trial, it was established, among other things, that the respondent had: (1) told Mr. Collin that he would take down the guys at the top to rearrange the face of theCrownprosecutor and one of the witnesses because he thought that he was the one who snitched on him; (2) informed Mr. Cloutier that he had hired a private detective to find theCrownprosecutor’s address; (3) asked Mr. Cloutier to do what was necessary to find the address of the officer-investigator; and (4) told Mr. Cloutier that once his trial was over he would kill the witnesses who had informed against him (2010 QCCQ 9043 (CanLII), at para. 6). B.Court of Québec, 2010 QCCQ 9043 (Decoste J.) [6]The respondent did not testify at trial (appeal decision, 2012 QCCA 236 (CanLII), at para. 18). The trial judge found that Messrs. Cloutier and Collin were credible witnesses (para. 12), but held that the fault element (themens rea) of the offences had not been established because the words were not conveyed by the respondent with the intent that they would be transmitted to the subjects of the threats in an attempt to influence their actions (paras. 14-15). He found that the respondent rather intended to seek revenge once the trial was done, and that he had uttered the words out of anger and frustration (paras. 14 and 16). C.Court of Appeal, 2012 QCCA 236 (Rochette and Giroux JJ.A. and Viens J. (ad hoc)) [7]The Court of Appeal confirmed the trial judge’s decision with regard to the fault element (paras. 16-18), and added that the prohibited act (theactus reus)had not been established because the words were uttered in a “closed circle” ― i.e. with an expectation of confidentiality ― and thus they could not instill fear in the subjects of the threats (paras. 8-9). The court confirmed the trial judge’s finding that the respondent acted out of frustration and with an intention to seek revenge rather than an intention to intimidate (para. 16).",

        "Facts": "[22]In sum, collateral immigration consequences may be just as relevant in sentencing as the collateral consequences of other legislation or of circumstances specific to the offender. [23]Where the issue of immigration consequences is brought to the trial judge’s attention and the trial judge applies the proper sentencing principles but nonetheless decides on a two-year sentence, then, absent fresh evidence, deference is owed to that decision. Where this issue has not been raised before the trial judge and the Crown does not give its consent, an affidavit or some other type of evidence should then be adduced for consideration by the Court of Appeal. [24]An appellate court has the authority to intervene if the sentencing judge was not aware of the collateral immigration consequences of the sentence for the offender, or if counsel had failed to advise the judge on this issue. In such circumstances, the court’s intervention is justified because the sentencing judge decided on the fitness of the sentence without considering a relevant factor:M. (C.A.), at para. 90. As I explained above, however, the aim of such an intervention is to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the facts of the particular case while taking all the relevant factors into account. Although there will be cases in which it is appropriate to reduce the sentence to ensure that it does not have adverse consequences for the offender’s immigration status, there will be other cases in which it is not appropriate to do so. [25]In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was not aware of the sentence’s collateral immigration consequences, and the appellate court accordingly had the authority to intervene. The Crown conceded both in the Court of Appeal and at the hearing in this Court that a reduced sentence of two years less a day remains within the range of otherwise fit sentences and that the imposed sentence of two years’ imprisonment should be reduced by one day. The Crown also agreed that the reduced sentence is the one that the sentencing judge would have imposed in the case at bar had he been aware of the collateral immigration consequences (R.F., at para. 69). It was wrong for the Court of Appeal to refuse the one-day reduction solely on the basis that the appellant had a prior criminal record or that it felt that he had “abused the hospitality that [had] been afforded to him by Canada” (para. 24). It is therefore appropriate to grant the variation of the sentence sought by the appellant.",

[22]Doyon J.A. provided a good overview of the general context in his reasons for the Court of Appeal’s decision (2012 QCCA 906 (CanLII)): [translation]In the middle of the night, several members of the group moved on to another restaurant/bar, on Ontario Street.  Around 5:00 a.m., they were asked to leave the premises.  Some of them gathered in the alley behind the bar.  A verbal altercation broke out between the victim and Pierre Mumpereze, also known as “Peter”, the appellant’s cousin.  A man named Rassem Chamaa intervened, but not for long, as things went no further.  He saw the two men who had been arguing head toward Ontario Street.  A few minutes later there was another altercation, in which the appellant was involved, that ended in the death of Mr. Rushemeza.  The appellant would be found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to imprisonment without eligibility for parole for at least 12 years.  [para. 10] [23]Although the different accounts of what happened are contradictory in some regards, they are consistent as they relate to the essential elements. [24]There are some facts that are worth noting.  From a fair distance away, the appellant saw that his cousin was involved in a fight with the victim, and he decided to run to where his cousin was and to intervene by pushing the victim back in order to get his cousin out of harm’s way.  He then noticed that his cousin was seriously wounded in the throat and that the victim was brandishing an exacto knife, using it to threaten the members of the group the appellant was with. [25]After pushing the victim, who was trying to defend himself by threatening his assailants with his knife, the appellant saw the victim drop his knife.  Fearing for his life should the victim pick his weapon up, the appellant then used his own knife, the blade of which was 20 centimetres long, to stab the victim several times. [26]According to the Crown’s theory, the appellant intentionally caused the victim’s death to take revenge for what the victim had done to his cousin.  According to the appellant, he stabbed the victim in response to an act of provocation.  Doyon J.A. explained the defence’s theory as follows: [translation]The appellant argued before the jury that he had had no choice.  Reacting emotionally and being “out of it”, to avoid being a victim himself, he had to defend himself by stabbing Mr. Rushemeza with his knife before Mr. Rushemeza had time to pick his own weapon up.  He struck without really knowing what part of the body he had hit or how many times he had stabbed him.  He never intended to wound the victim seriously while being reckless as to whether death ensued.  He was afraid for his life after seeing his cousin stabbed in the throat by an aggressive person who was armed and was bigger than him, and who was threatening him.  He acted as he did in self‑defence, to save his life, without there being time for his passion to cool.  [para. 32] [27]At the end of the pre‑charge conference, the appellant suggested that the trial judge put both self‑defence and provocation to the jury as defences. [28]The trial judge, Champagne J., citing,inter alia, the comments made by my colleague Moldaver J. inR. v. Pintar(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), stated: [translation]So, after considering the view expressed by my colleague Moldaver J.A. inPintarand briefly reviewing the evidence produced by Mr. Buzizi before the triers of fact, I found it unlikely that Mr. Buzizi could not have intended to kill the victim; this is because he had in his possession a 30‑centimetre‑long knife that he plunged at least twice into the victim’s back to a depth of 18 centimetres while the victim was bent over. I also took into account from the testimony of the accused that he was scared and highly emotional, that he was afraid, that the guy, that is to say, the victim, was a big, burly man, that his life was in danger, that his cousin’s throat had been cut and that he himself had been attacked. As a result, I conclude that the only defence I should put to the jury is the one provided for ins. 34(2)of theCriminal Code of Canada. [A.R., at pp. 2182‑83]",

        "Facts": "[2]In 2009, Mr. MacDonald was employed in the oil and gas industry.  His employment required him to spend time in both Calgary and Halifax.  On the evening of December 28, 2009, Mr. MacDonald entertained a co-worker and his co-worker’s friend at his Halifax condominium (the “unit”).  Some alcohol was consumed during the evening as Mr. MacDonald and his colleague — who was about to replace him in Halifax — discussed work. [3]Later in the evening, the concierge of Mr. MacDonald’s building, Mr. Sears, received a noise complaint regarding loud music reverberating from the unit.  Mr. Sears went to the unit, heard the loud music and knocked on the door.  He received no response.  Just as he was about to leave, he saw Mr. MacDonald’s guests leaving the unit and saying good night.  At this point, Mr. Sears asked Mr. MacDonald to turn down his music.  Mr. MacDonald, swearing at him, refused to do so. [4]Mr. Sears contacted the Halifax Regional Police and asked them to deal with the complaint about the noise issue.  Cst. Pierce went to the building and, together with Mr. Sears, approached Mr. MacDonald’s unit.  Cst. Pierce knocked on his door and asked him to turn his music down or off.  Mr. MacDonald swore at her and slammed the door shut. [5]Cst. Pierce contacted her supervisor, Sgt. Boyd, who arrived at the building approximately a half hour later.  Sgt. Boyd, Cst. Pierce and Mr. Sears went to the unit.  Sgt. Boyd tried to get Mr. MacDonald to answer the door by knocking on it and kicking it, and also shouted that he was from the Halifax Regional Police. [6]About five minutes later, Mr. MacDonald opened the door, but only about 16 inches — enough for the officers to see the right side of his body and face.  Sgt. Boyd noticed something “black and shiny” in Mr. MacDonald’s right hand that was in a shadow and was partially hidden by his right leg (A.R., at p. 167).  He believed it might be a knife.  He twice asked Mr. MacDonald what was behind his leg, gesturing toward his right hand.  Mr. MacDonald did not respond. [7]Wanting to get a better look at what Mr. MacDonald had in his hand, Sgt. Boyd pushed the door open a few inches further.  The resulting light enabled him to identify it as a handgun.  He yelled “gun!” and quickly forced his way into the unit.  After a brief struggle, he was able to disarm Mr. MacDonald. [8]The gun that Mr. MacDonald was holding when he opened the door was found to be a 9-mm Beretta — a restricted firearm.  It was registered to him.  The gun was loaded. [9]Mr. MacDonald was charged with numerous offences, three of which are relevant here:  handling a firearm in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons, contrary to s. 86(1) of theCode; unlawfully having in his possession a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88(1); and possessing, in a place, a loaded restricted firearm without being the holder of an authorization or a licence under which he may possess the said firearm in that place, contrary to s. 95(1).",

        "Facts": "[184]Consistent withCharterjurisprudence,the onus is on the accused to establish aprima faciebreach of the principle against self-incrimination.  To do so, the accused must show that concerns about autonomy, reliability, and police conduct exist, as they will in nearly every Mr. Big operation.  In such circumstances, the burden will shift to the Crown to establish that there is no breach.  Consequently, the Crown should always be prepared to demonstrate the admissibility of the resulting evidence.  This will encourage the police to give careful consideration to the constitutionality of the operation and will incentivize recording of the Mr. Big “scenarios” where possible.  Given that the entire operation, not just the final meeting, is relevant to the admissibility of any evidence obtained, thorough records would make it easier for the court to assess the investigation and would allow the police to defend against allegations of undue coercion or state misconduct. [185]The principle against self-incrimination also works to secure trial fairness, which is a principle of fundamental justice recognized underss. 7and11(d)of theCharter.  Trial fairness may be compromised whenever there are concerns about how police have obtained self-incriminating evidence, where such evidence is of dubious reliability, and where juries have difficulty evaluating the truthfulness of confessions.  There is scope to consider all of these factors under the principle against self-incrimination. C.Applying the Principle Against Self-Incrimination to Mr. Big Cases [186]The Court applied the principle against self-incrimination inWhite.  TheWhiteframework deals directly with three interrelated concerns which ground the traditional rules respecting confessions to the state:  autonomy, reliability, and state conduct.  As the Court explained,",

            "[26]                          At the appellant’s trial, the Crown conceded that the wiretap authorization it had obtained to intercept the appellant’s phone calls did not comply with the requirements of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and had therefore been obtained in violation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .[2]  As a result of this violation, the Crown did not adduce any of the conversations that had been intercepted pursuant to the wiretap authorization.  Nonetheless, the appellant moved to have all of the statements he made during the Mr. Big operation — none of which were recorded on the wiretaps — excluded as well.  The appellant argued that the illegal wiretap was being used to design the undercover operation and that the operation would not have been conducted without it.  As a result, the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr. Big operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding his statements to the undercover officers under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .",
            "[43]                          In Hart, this Court identified two evidentiary concerns with confessions that are the product of a Mr. Big operation.  The first is that the confessions may be unreliable.  Mr. Big operations are intended to induce confessions, and the inducements offered to a suspect may incentivize the suspect to falsely confess.  Second, Mr. Big confessions are invariably accompanied by bad character evidence in which the accused has shown a willingness to commit crimes to gain entry into a criminal organization (see Hart, at paras. 68-77).",
            "[55]                          With respect to the bad character evidence that accompanies a Mr. Big confession, the challenge is a more familiar one.  The trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been admitted for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession.  The jury should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining whether the accused is guilty.  Moreover, the trial judge should remind the jury that the simulated criminal activity — even that which the accused may have eagerly participated in — was fabricated and encouraged by agents of the state."

        "Facts": "[19]Scott C.J.M. proposed the following approach for determining whether a given threat amounts to an attempted use of violence (para. 85): [S]ome degree of physical action must be part of a threat for it to constitute the “attempted use of violence”. That is, there needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a person or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence against a person for a threat of violence to also constitute the attempted use of violence. [20]Finally, Scott C.J.M. noted that McKelvey J.’s findings of fact had not been challenged, and because the threat of violence was not associated with either imminent danger or “any, even minimal, overt physical act”, he upheld the trial judge’s decision (para. 86). The threat, while sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343(a), did not constitute the use or attempted use of violence for the purposes of the definition of an SPIO and did not trigger the sentencing procedures under Part XXIV. IV.Issue [21]Does robbery committed by using threats of violence to a person within the meaning ofs. 343(a) of theCriminal Codeconstitute an SPIO in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of that expression set out in s. 752? V.Analysis [22]To determine whether an offence constitutes an SPIO, it is necessary to review the elements of the offence, but it may also be necessary, if that review is insufficient, to consider the factual circumstances in which the offence was committed. Certain offences automatically constitute SPIOs regardless of the manner in which they are committed: s. 752, para. (b) of the definition of “serious personal injury offence”; seeR. v. Currie, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, at paras. 21-22. There are other offences that always constitute SPIOs in that one of their elements automatically satisfies the descriptive criteria set out in para. (a) of the definition of an SPIO.  One example would be where personal violence or endangerment forms part of the definition of the offence: see, e.g.,R. v. Cepic,2010 ONSC 561, 93 M.V.R. (5th) 129, at para. 18. Robbery is clearly not one of this second type of offences, since it can involve the use of violence or threats of violence to a personor property, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO refers only to the use or attempted use of violenceagainst another person: seeLebar,at para. 65. [23]Thus, the question is whether a robbery committed as in the instant case — by using threats of violence to a person, but without using actual physical violence — satisfies the criterion of “use or attempted use of violence against another person” set out in the definition. I conclude that it does. I reach this conclusion in light of the modern principle of statutory interpretation that the words of legislation must be read “in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: E. A. Driedger,Construction of Statutes(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. [24]I will begin by discussing the purpose of the SPIO threshold and its function within the scheme of Part XXIV. I will then consider the plain meaning of the term “violence” in the context of theCriminal Codeand other legislation. Finally, I will discuss the statutory context of the provision in which the phrase “use or attempted use of violence” appears, including the other provisions of the definition of an SPIO and the provision that defines the offence of robbery. Taken together, these considerations support the view that threats of violence to a person that suffice to ground a conviction for robbery meet the violence criterion in the definition of an SPIO. Because robbery is an indictable offence for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more, all the criteria of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO are satisfied. A.Purpose of the SPIO Requirement [25]The Crown emphasizes that the SPIO requirement serves as a gateway in that it is applied before an offender is assessed for dangerousness and before an application can be made for a finding that he or she is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. The “use or attempted use of violence” criterion must therefore, the Crown argues, be interpreted broadly to ensure that offenders who might meet the criteria are not excluded from being assessed, which would undermine the goal of public protection. [26]Mr. Steele counters that the SPIO requirement performs an important function in Part XXIV by ensuring that offenders may only be sentenced to indeterminate detention for sufficiently serious crimes. He argues that an overly broad construction of this requirement would frustrate the scheme’s objective of proportionality. [27]As I will explain, both these purposive arguments have merit. The general purpose of Part XXIV is public protection, and an overly narrow construction of the gateway provision would indeed undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an overly broad construction would undermine this purpose and jeopardize the objective of proportionality. My interpretive approach must be sensitive to both the general and the specific purpose.  I will now discuss each of these purposes in detail and will conclude that the seriousness requirement of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO is satisfied by a textual and contextual interpretation of the words “use or attempted use of violence”, and that it would be wrong to read in an objective minimum level of violence. (1)General Purpose of the Dangerous and Long-term Offender Provisions [28]Part XXIV of theCriminal Codeauthorizes the indeterminate detention of individuals who are found to be “dangerous offender[s]” on the basis that their past conduct and patterns of behaviour show that they constitute a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons (s. 753(1)(a)), or that their failure to control sexual impulses means that they are likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to other persons (s. 753(1)(b)). It also authorizes the long-term supervision of individuals who are found to be “long-term offender[s]” where a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more would be appropriate, there is a substantial risk that the individuals will reoffend, and there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of that risk in the community (s. 753.1(1)).",

            "[1]                              Rothstein J. — Nahoor Araya was tried by a judge and jury for second degree murder and convicted of the included offence of manslaughter for his alleged involvement in a shooting that took place in a Toronto park on October 3, 2008. The Ontario Court of Appeal (Strathy J.A. (as he then was), dissenting) overturned that conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that the jury instructions given at trial were insufficient to warn the jury against making improper inferences with regard to certain photographs of Mr. Araya taken a few days after the shooting and admitted at trial. The Crown appeals this decision and asks that the manslaughter conviction be restored. In the alternative, the Crown argues that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .",
            "[10]                          Mr. Araya was tried before a jury in 2011 on the basis that he was among the assailants on the night of the shooting, and was thus liable for second degree murder pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . The Crown did not allege that Mr. Araya was the shooter. Eyewitnesses to the event testified to their recollections about the description of the assailants. As noted above, these descriptions were limited to vague, general characteristics – young, black, thin, and clean-shaven.",
            "(2)        Whether the majority at the Court of Appeal erred in failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .",
            "[30]                          Under s. 686(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , a court of appeal may allow an appeal against a conviction where the verdict is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, where there has been a wrong decision on a question of law, or where a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Mr. Araya asserts that the trial judge’s decision to admit the photographs, his instructions to the jury regarding the permissible use of the photographs, and his instructions regarding the use of Mr. Browne’s testimony each amounted to a miscarriage of justice. Based on the grounds raised, I am of the opinion that these arguments are properly understood as assertions that the trial judge engaged in misdirection or non-direction of the jury amounting to errors of law.",
            "[32]                          Under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code , an accused may be found culpable of an offence if that person shares a common intent to commit an unlawful act with one or more other people, and one of those other people commits an offence that the defendant knew or ought to have known was a probable consequence of the plan.[1] In this case, Mr. Araya was convicted of manslaughter under this party liability provision; while the Crown did not assert that Mr. Araya was the shooter, it did argue that Mr. Araya was among the group of assailants, and that the shooting was a probable consequence of their plan to accost Mr. Cikovic’s group in the park. Accordingly, the Crown needed to establish that Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park at the time of the shooting, as well as the extent of his involvement in the assailants’ common intent to commit robbery and that he knew or should have known that the shooting was a probable consequence of that plan.",
            "If on the totality of the evidence you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was in that park that night, then you must go on to determine if he committed any criminal offence. As I mentioned earlier, simply being present at the scene of a crime is not enough to find a person guilty of an offence. So assuming you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in the park, you would go to the next step. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 95-97]",

C-46  (“Code ”), and one count each of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270(1) (a) of the Code . In addition, Mr. Simpson was charged with one count of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code and two counts of drug possession under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , S.C. 1996, c. 19 .",
            "[43]                          The trial judge held that Ms. Farrell was acting in lawful self-defence when she hit Sergeant Barbeau. Regrettably, her discussion on this point is cursory. She did not refer to any of the self-defence provisions in the Criminal Code , nor offer any detailed analysis. Despite the lack of analysis, it is evident that the trial judge’s conclusion hinges on her finding that Ms. Farrell “reacted in order to protect Mr. Simpson” whom “she felt . . . had been unlawfully assaulted by the police officer”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 19. The Court of Appeal’s reasons make no mention of this finding. However, Thibault J.A. concluded that a new trial should be ordered on all charges, and I agree. As I will explain, the trial judge’s error on the colour of right issue carries over and taints Ms. Farrell’s acquittal on the charge of assaulting a police officer.",

            "[2]                              The appellant, Mr. Riesberry, tried to rig two horse races by drugging two horses. The question at the bottom of this appeal is whether the provisions of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , under which he was charged can apply to this conduct.",
            "[3]                              Mr. Riesberry was a licensed trainer of Standardbred horses. He was caught on video drugging one horse, and caught trying to sneak syringes with drugs into the track for the purpose of doing the same thing to another.  For the drugging caught on tape, he was charged with cheating while playing a game (a horse race) with the intent to defraud the public wagering money on its outcome (s. 209  of the Criminal Code ) and with defrauding the public of money wagered on the outcome of a horse race (s. 380(1)).  For trying to sneak the drugs into the track, he was charged with attempting to commit the same offences. At trial, he was acquitted. However, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittals on all four counts, ordered a new trial on the cheating and attempted cheating counts (“cheating counts”) and entered convictions on the fraud and attempted fraud counts (“fraud counts”): 2014 ONCA 744, 122 O.R. (3d) 594.",
            "[5]                              With respect to the cheating counts, the main questions are (i) whether the trial judge made a legal error in his interpretation of what constitutes a “game”; and (ii) whether there was any evidence that could establish that a horse race is a “game” as defined in s. 197  of the Criminal Code  for these offences.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in this respect and that there was evidence that could establish that a horse race is a game as defined for these offences.",
            "[9]                              With respect to the cheating while playing a game charges, the trial judge concluded that a horse race is not a game as defined in the Criminal Code  and therefore the charges were not made out. The first issue is whether the trial judge erred in law in his legal interpretation of what constitutes a “game” for the purposes of this offence.",
            "[10]                          The charges against Mr. Riesberry arise under s. 209  of the Criminal Code  which provides that everyone is guilty of an offence who, “with intent to defraud any person, cheats while playing a game”. “Game” is defined as “a game of chance or mixed chance and skill”: s. 197(1). It follows that the Crown had to establish that a horse race is a game with at least some element of chance. The trial judge relied on the U.S. case of Harless v. United States, 1 Morris 169 (Iowa 1843), to conclude that a horse race is a game of pure skill.",
            "[11]                          It is somewhat unclear to what extent the trial judge relied on this authority as stating the law in Canada. However, to the extent that he did so, he made a legal error. The statute considered by the U.S. court divided games into only two categories, games of chance and games of skill. That case, therefore, did not address a point that must be addressed under the Criminal Code . That point is whether horse racing is a game of mixed chance and skill. The applicable Canadian law on this point is found in Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 786. There must be a “systematic resort to chance” to determine outcomes, not merely the “unpredictables that may occasionally defeat skill”: p. 791."

[42]The second is fromR. v. Dipnarine, 2014 ABCA 328, 584 A.R. 138, at paras. 22 and 24-25. The court stated that “[c]ircumstantial evidence does not have to totally exclude other conceivable inferences”; that the trier of fact should not act on alternative interpretations of the circumstances that it considers to be unreasonable; and that alternative inferences must be reasonable, not just possible. [43]Where the line is to be drawn between speculation and reasonable inferences in a particular case cannot be described with greater clarity than it is in these passages. (b)Did the Trial Judge Err? [44]I return to the question of whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to find a legal error in relation to circumstantial evidence in the trial judge’s reasons. [45]The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred because he failed to consider reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt that could have arisen froma lack of evidence.  The court found that, by failing to give the accused the benefit of “gaps” in the evidence, the trial judge had, in effect, put a burden on the accused to prove something: paras. 19-20. The respondent supports that conclusion and makes two additional points. He submits that the trial judge erred in relying onMcIverwhich wrongly required inferences alternative to guilt to be supported by the evidence and that the trial judge relied on inapplicable sources —certiorariapplications to quash committals to stand trial, where the beyond a reasonable doubt standard does not apply.  In doing so, it is submitted, the judge failed to appreciate the burden of proof on the Crown and the difference between the standard applied when deciding to commit someone to stand trial at a preliminary inquiry and the reasonable doubt standard applied at trial. [46]I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion and I cannot accept the respondent’s submissions.",

            "Criminal Code ,   R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, ss. 249(4)  [rep. & sub. 2018, c. 21, ss. 14, 15], 676(1)(a), 686(4)(b)(ii).",
            "[1]                             Mr. Chung was acquitted of dangerous driving causing death under s. 249(4) [1] of the Criminal Code ,   R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (“Code ”). At trial and on appeal, there was no question that Mr. Chung drove in an objectively dangerous manner and committed the actus reus of the charged offence. However, the trial judge had a reasonable doubt about whether Mr. Chung had the requisite guilty mind or mens rea (2018 BCPC 133, 29 M.V.R. (7th) 122). On appeal, the sole issue was whether the trial judge committed an error of law in finding that Mr. Chung lacked the requisite mens rea (2019 BCCA 206, 55 C.R. (7th) 459). The British Columbia Court of Appeal found such an error of law. Reading the trial judgment fully and fairly, I conclude that there was an error of law and that this appeal must be dismissed.",
            "[6]                             However, the trial judge acquitted Mr. Chung because he had reasonable doubt that Mr. Chung’s conduct met the mens rea requirement for dangerous driving. The trial judge distinguished the facts of this case from circumstances where excessive speed met the mens rea requirement and emphasized that the momentariness of Mr. Chung’s speeding was critical in finding that his conduct did not show criminal fault.",
            "[15]                         The trial judge found that Mr. Chung’s dangerous conduct was only limited to the one block span where he accelerated to almost three times the speed limit, passing at least one car on the right, nearly hit the Toyota turning right in front of him, and then collided with the victim’s vehicle. The trial judge concluded that Mr. Chung had not been inattentive while driving. The trial judge then canvassed a line of cases which he believed supported the principle that speeding alone is rarely sufficient to establish the mens rea for dangerous driving. He distinguished these cases, finding that in these cases speeding was more than momentary or there was some other additional dangerous conduct that was not present in the case at bar. The trial judge emphasized that Mr. Chung’s speed was momentary, noting that although momentary conduct can be a marked departure, it will more usually be only a mere departure where driving is otherwise proper (para. 117, citing R. v. Willock (2006), 212 O.A.C. 82, per Doherty J.A.). Therefore, he had reasonable doubt that Mr. Chung’s conduct represented a marked departure because the “momentariness of the accused’s conduct in excessively speeding [was] insufficient to meet the criminal fault component” (paras. 119-120).",
            "[22]                         Although this Court in Roy and Beatty determined that momentary lapses in attention and judgment would usually not raise criminal liability, this was because momentary lapses often result from the “automatic and reflexive nature of driving” (Beatty, at para. 34) or “[s]imple carelessness, to which even the most prudent drivers may occasionally succumb” (Roy, at para. 37). These are examples of conduct that, when assessed in totality against the reasonable person standard, only represent a mere departure from the norm. Momentary conduct is not assessed differently from other dangerous conduct. Conduct that occurs over a brief period of time that creates foreseeable and immediate risks of serious consequences can still be a marked departure from the norm (Beatty, at para. 48). A reasonable person would have foreseen that rapidly accelerating towards a major intersection at a high speed creates a very real risk of a collision occurring within seconds. This is what actually occurred in Mr. Chung’s case. Risky conduct at excessive speeds foreseeably can result in immediate consequences. Therefore, the fact that foreseeable consequences occur within a short period of time after someone engages in highly dangerous behaviour cannot preclude a finding of mens rea for dangerous driving.",
            "[28]                         A reasonable person understands that driving is an inherently risky activity. It is made all the more risky the faster we drive, the harder we accelerate, and the more aggressively we navigate traffic. Although even careful driving can result in tragic consequences, some conduct is so dangerous that it deserves criminal sanctions.",
            "[31]                         Karakatsanis J. (dissenting) — Crown rights of appeal from acquittals are limited to questions of law alone: Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 676(1) (a). In particular, this Court has emphasized that there is no ground of “unreasonable acquittal” open to the Crown on appeal: see R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at paras. 32-33. Not only is no such Crown right of appeal provided for in the Code , but “as a matter of law, the concept of ‘unreasonable acquittal’ is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the burden which rests on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt”: J.M.H., at para. 27, citing R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 33. The fact that an acquittal may be on its face unreasonable, or even “manifestly” unreasonable, does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that a legal error was committed in coming to the decision to acquit. Appellate intervention in an acquittal is only available when the Crown establishes that the trial judge’s reasonable doubt is tainted by an identifiable legal error: J.M.H., at para. 39. Appellate jurisdiction does not extend to questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law. Parliament’s clear policy choice to tightly circumscribe the scope of Crown appeals from acquittal must be respected.",
            "[33]                         Busy trial judges cannot be expected to write perfect reasons. Appellate courts approach a trial judge’s reasons by reading them as a whole rather than finely parsing them, presuming that the trial judge knows the basic principles of criminal law: see for example R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 16, 35, 45 and 54. On a Crown appeal from an acquittal, this Court has further emphasized that the adequacy of a trial judge’s reasons is informed by the limited nature of the Crown’s appeal rights: J.M.H., at para. 32, citing R. v. Walker, 2008 SCC 34, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 2 and 22. This context calls for restraint: R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 17."

            "[1]                             In 1985, Parliament enacted s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , to allow courts of appeal to uphold a conviction where, despite a procedural irregularity at trial, the “trial court had jurisdiction over the class of offence” and the court of appeal was of the opinion that “the appellant suffered no prejudice” as a result of the error (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985, R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 145(1)).",
            "[4]                             In April 2013, the respondents, Chiheb Esseghaier and Raed Jaser, were charged with a series of terrorism offences under the Criminal Code . In light of the seriousness of the allegations and the high‑profile nature of the case, the parties agreed that challenges for cause were necessary to ensure the impartiality of the jury.",
            "[5]                             At the time, the Criminal Code  provided two procedures for trying challenges for cause — rotating triers and static triers. Mr. Jaser wanted rotating triers. He also wanted the trial judge to exercise his common law discretion to exclude prospective jurors from the courtroom during the challenge for cause process. If his request could not be satisfied, he wanted static triers.",
            "[6]                             The trial judge refused Mr. Jaser’s request, concluding that trial judges no longer had the authority to exclude unsworn jurors where the rotating triers process was being used. In any event, he would not have exercised the discretion even if he had it. To grant Mr. Jaser’s request would be to expose the sworn jurors — members of the jury — to the potentially partial comments of prospective jurors and, thereby, risk undermining trial fairness. The trial judge thus imposed static triers in accordance with Mr. Jaser’s alternate position. Mr. Esseghaier, who rejected the authority of the Criminal Code  in its entirety, made no submissions as to the appropriate procedure for trying the challenges for cause.",
            "[11]                         On April 22, 2013, Mr. Esseghaier and Mr. Jaser were arrested and charged with various terrorism offences under Part II.1 of the Criminal Code . Specifically, both men were charged with conspiracy to damage transportation infrastructure with intent to endanger safety for the benefit of a terrorist group (ss. 83.2, 248 and 465(1)(c)), conspiracy to commit murder for the benefit of a terrorist group (ss. 83.2 and 465(1)(a)), and two counts each of participating in or contributing to the activity of a terrorist group (s. 83.18(1)). Mr. Esseghaier was also charged with a further count of participating in or contributing to the activity of a terrorist group.",
            "[14]                         First, on March 14, 2014, after it had become clear that Mr. Esseghaier would likely be self‑represented, the Crown moved for the appointment of amicus curiae. The trial judge granted this motion, finding that there were “specific and exceptional circumstances” that justified the appointment of amicus in a limited role (2014 ONSC 2277, at para. 41 (CanLII), quoting Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 47 and 115).",
            "[16]                         As we have already noted (at para. 5), the Criminal Code  provided at the time two methods for trying challenges for cause — rotating triers and static triers. Rotating triers involved two random members of the jury panel serving as triers until the first jury member was chosen. The first juror would then replace one of the triers (who would be excused) and assume the role of trying whether the next prospective juror was impartial. This rotational pattern would continue until the full petit jury was selected.",
            "[18]                         Even after the 2008 amendments, rotating triers remained the default procedure. The static triers procedure would be applied only where the accused person sought the exclusion of all sworn and unsworn (prospective) jurors, and where the trial judge agreed that exclusion was “necessary to preserve the impartiality of the jurors” (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal procedure, language of the accused, sentencing and other amendments), S.C. 2008, c. 18, s. 26).[1]",
            "[27]                         In light of the decision to bifurcate, the only issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge had erred in denying Mr. Jaser’s request for rotating triers with prospective jurors excluded and, if so, whether that error could be cured by application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal Code .",
            "(2)                   If the jury was improperly constituted, did the Court of Appeal err in finding that the error could not be cured by the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal Code ?",
            "[34]                         As a result of the error, the jury was improperly constituted for Mr. Jaser, as it was incorrectly selected by static triers instead of rotating triers with prospective jurors excluded. The jury was also improperly constituted for Mr. Esseghaier, as he was improperly denied his right to rotating triers, the default procedure under the Criminal Code .",

        "Facts": "[46]In practice, the new provisions are simultaneously more generous to the accused and more restrictive: the provisions narrow the scope of self‑defence in some factual circumstances and broaden it in others (R. v. Bengy, 2015 ONCA 397, 325 C.C.C. (3d) 22, at paras. 47-48; Paciocco (2014), at p. 296). The transposition of mandatory conditions into mere factors suggests more flexibility in accessing the defence, but this added flexibility is counter-balanced by the requirement to consider certain factors — including proportionality and the availability of other means to respond to the use or threat of force — in every case in which they are relevant, regardless of the genesis of the confrontation or the features of the dispute. [47]The question also arises whether the amendments have altered the scope or nature of self-defence by shifting its moral foundation from justification to excuse. On a justificatory account of self-defence, killing in self-defence is not considered wrongful because it upholds the right to life and autonomy of the person acting. It is grounded on the necessity of self-preservation (R. v. Pilon, 2009 ONCA 248, 243 C.C.C. (3d) 109, at para. 68). In contrast, an excuse negates the blameworthiness of the accused. It mainly works by denying the voluntary character of an act that is nevertheless wrongful. A number of theorists have questioned whether self-defence is a justification, especially outside the classic case of defence against an unlawful use of force. They are divided in cases where the accused uses force against a reasonably perceived threat that does not exist in fact, against an attack that they have provoked, and when the defending act is not proportional or necessary (A. Brudner, “Constitutionalizing self-defence” (2011), 61U.T.L.J.867, at pp. 891-95; C. Fehr, “Self-Defence and the Constitution” (2017), 43Queen’s L.J.85, at p. 109; K. Ferzan, “Justification and Excuse”, in J. Deigh and D. Dolinko, eds.,The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of the Criminal Law(2011), 239, at p. 253; K. Roach, “A Preliminary Assessment of the New Self‑Defence and Defence of Property Provisions” (2012), 16Can. Crim. L. Rev.275, at p. 276-77). In such cases, the defending act is not considered rightful or tolerable by many authors, but guilt can be avoided when the circumstances call into question the voluntariness of the act, which brings it closer to an excuse and the law of necessity. [48]The 2013 amendments further obscure the moral foundation of self-defence. The new provisions retain the underlying principle that the accused’s actions are a response to an external threat to their bodily integrity. However, unlike the old law, the self-defence provisions no longer use the language of justification. Section 34 simply states that the accused “is not guilty of an offence” where the requirements of the defence are met. Further, the elimination of an “unlawfu[l] assaul[t]” (per the previous s. 34(1)) or an “apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm” (per the previous s. 34(2)) as discrete triggering features arguably removes any residual boundary between the “morally justifiable” and “morally excusable” categories of the defence. Some argue that the new s. 34 may accommodate a continuum of moral conduct, including acts that are merely “morally permissible” where the threat and response meet a reasoned equilibrium (Fehr, at p. 102). This suggests the defence is neither purely a justification nor an excuse, instead occupying a middle ground of “permissibility” between rightfulness and blamelessness. As will become apparent, the line between justification and excuse has been blurred by the amendments, and this must be taken into consideration in interpreting the new provisions. Because the defence is now available in circumstances that may not fit neatly within the traditional justification-based framework, the need to consider all of the accused’s conduct over the course of the incident that is relevant to the reasonableness of the act of purported self-defence takes on greater importance. [49]To summarize, while a driving purpose of the amendments was to simplify the law of self‑defence in Canada, Parliament also effected a significant shift. It is widely recognized by appellate courts across the country and academics that these amendments resulted in substantive changes to the law of self‑defence (Bengy, at paras. 45-50;R. v. Evans, 2015 BCCA 46, 321 C.C.C. (3d) 130, at paras. 19‑20 and 30;R. v. Green, 2015 QCCA 2109, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 73, at paras. 49‑50;R. v. Power, 2016 SKCA 29, 335 C.C.C. (3d) 317, at para. 26;R. v. Cormier, 2017 NBCA 10, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 97, at para. 46;R. v. Carriere, 2013 ABQB 645, 86 Alta L.R. (5th) 219, at paras. 92‑101;R. v. Chubbs, 2013 NLCA 60, 341 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 346, at para. 7; see also Department of Justice,Bill C‑26 (S.C. 2012 c. 9) Reforms to Self‑Defence and Defence of Property: Technical Guide for Practitioners, March 2013 (online) (“Technical Guide”), at pp. 10‑28; Fehr, at p. 88; Paciocco (2014), at p. 271; D. Watt,Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions(2nd ed. 2015), at p. 1255). The words “person’s role in the incident” in s. 34(2)(c) must be interpreted in light of the expansive and substantive changes to the law and not read simply with reference to the old provisions. [50]I will now turn to a more detailed review of the three inquiries under s. 34 before setting out how the new phrase “person’s role in the incident” under s. 34(2)(c) should be interpreted. C.The Three Inquiries Under Section 34 [51]The three inquiries under s. 34(1), set out above, can usefully be conceptualized as (1) the catalyst; (2) the motive; and (3) the response (Technical Guide, at p. 11; C.A. reasons, at para. 42; see also S. Coughlan, “The Rise and Fall of Duress: How Duress Changed Necessity Before Being Excluded by Self‑Defence” (2013), 39Queen’s L.J.83, at p. 116). I will now discuss each of these inquiries separately. (1)The Catalyst— Paragraph 34(1)(a): Did the Accused Believe, on Reasonable Grounds, that Force Was Being Used or Threatened Against Them or Another Person? [52]This element of self‑defence considers the accused’s state of mind and the perception of events that led them to act. As stated previously, the new provisions include both defence of self and defence of another. Unless the accused subjectively believed that force or a threat thereof was being used against their person or that of another, the defence is unavailable. [53]Importantly, the accused’s actual belief must be held “on reasonable grounds”. Good reason supports the overlay of an objective component when assessing an accused’s belief under s. 34(1)(a) and in the law of self‑defence more generally. As self‑defence operates to shield otherwise criminal acts from punitive consequence, the defence cannot depend exclusively on an individual accused’s perception of the need to act. The reference to reasonableness incorporates community norms and values in weighing the moral blameworthiness of the accused’s actions (Cinous, at para. 121). It “is a quality control measure used to maintain a standard of conduct that is acceptable not to the subject, but to society at large” (Paciocco (2014), at p. 278). [54]The test to judge the reasonableness of the accused’s belief under the self-defence provisions has traditionally been understood to be a blended or modified objective standard. Reasonableness was not measured “from the perspective of the hypothetically neutral reasonable man, divorced from the appellant’s personal circumstances” (R. v. Charlebois, 2000 SCC 53, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 674, at para. 18). Instead, it was contextualized to some extent: the accused’s beliefs were assessed from the perspective of an ordinary person who shares the attributes, experiences and circumstances of the accused where those characteristics and experiences were relevant to the accused’s belief or actions (Lavallee, at p. 883). [55]For example, an accused’s prior violent encounters with the victim were taken into account to assess whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that they faced an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm (Pétel,at p. 13-14;Lavallee, at pp. 874 and 889;Charlebois,at para. 14;R. v. Currie(2002),166 C.C.C. (3d) 190 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 43-44;R. v. Sheri(2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 77). An accused’s mental disabilities were also considered in the reasonableness assessment (Nelson, at pp. 370-72;R. v. Kagan, 2004 NSCA 77, 224 N.S.R. (2d) 118, at paras. 37-45). [56]However, not all personal characteristics or experiences are relevant to the modified objective inquiry. The personal circumstances of the accused that influence their beliefs — be they noble, anti-social or criminal — should not undermine theCriminal Code’s most basic purpose of promoting public order (Cinous, at para. 128, per Binnie J., concurring). Reasonableness is not considered through the eyes of individuals who are overly fearful, intoxicated, abnormally vigilant or members of criminal subcultures (Reillyv. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 396, at p. 405;Cinous, at para. 129-30;R. v. Phillips, 2017 ONCA 752, 355 C.C.C. (3d) 141, at para. 98). Similarly, the ordinary person standard is “informed by contemporary norms of behaviour, including fundamental values such as the commitment to equality provided for in theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” (R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 34). Personal prejudices or irrational fears towards an ethnic group or identifiable culture could never acceptably inform an objectively reasonable perception of a threat. This limitation ensures that racist beliefs which are antithetical to equality cannot ground a belief held on reasonable grounds. Doherty J.A. succinctly illustrated this principle in his reasons in this appeal, at para. 49: For example, an accused’s “honest” belief that all young black men are armed and dangerous could not be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of that accused’s belief that the young black man he shot was armed and about to shoot him. To colour the reasonableness inquiry with racist views would undermine the very purpose of that inquiry. The justificatory rationale for the defence is inimical to a defence predicated on a belief that is inconsistent with essential community values and norms. [57]The question is not therefore what the accused thought was reasonable based on their characteristics and experiences, but rather what a reasonable person with those relevant characteristics and experiences would perceive (Pilon,at para. 74).The law also continues to accept that an honest but mistaken belief can nevertheless be reasonable and does not automatically bar a claim to self‑defence (Lavallee, at p. 874;Pétel, at p. 13;R. v. Billing, 2019 BCCA 237, 379 C.C.C. (3d) 285, at para. 9;R. v. Robinson,2019 ABQB 889, at para. 23 (CanLII);R. v. Cunha, 2016 ONCA 491, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at para. 8). [58]Reasonableness is ultimately a matter of judgment and “[t]o brand a belief as unreasonable in the context of a self‑defence claim is to declare the accused’s act criminally blameworthy” (C.A. reasons, at para. 46; see alsoCinous, at para. 210, per Arbour J. in dissent but not on this point;Pilon, at para. 75;Phillips, at para. 98; G. P. Fletcher, “The Right and the Reasonable”, in R. L. Christopher, ed.,Fletcher’s Essays on Criminal Law(2013), 150, at p. 157). (2)The Motive— Paragraph 34(1)(b): Did the Accused Do Something for the Purpose of Defending or Protecting Themselves or Another Person from that Use or Threat of Force? [59]The second element of self‑defence considers the accused’s personal purpose in committing the act that constitutes the offence. Section 34(1)(b) requires that the act be undertaken by the accused to defend or protect themselves or others from the use or threat of force. This is a subjective inquiry which goes to the root of self‑defence. If there is no defensive or protective purpose, the rationale for the defence disappears (seeBrunelle v. R., 2021 QCCA 783, at paras. 30-33;R. v. Craig, 2011 ONCA 142, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 61, at para. 35; Paciocco (2008), at p. 29). The motive provision thus ensures that the actions of the accused are not undertaken for the purpose of vigilantism, vengeance or some other personal motivation. [60]The motive provision also distinguishes self‑defence from other situations that may involve the excusable or authorized application of force by an accused, such as preventing the commission of an offence (s. 27), defence of property (s. 35) or citizen’s arrest (s. 494). Clarity as to the accused’s purpose is critical, as the spectrum of what qualifies as a reasonable response may be limited by the accused’s purpose at any given point in time. The range of reasonable responses will be different depending on whether the accused’s purpose is to defend property, effect an arrest, or defend themselves or another from the use of force. [61]An accused’s purpose for acting may evolve as an incident progresses or escalates. Parliament’s decision to modify the law of defence of person, defence of property and citizen’s arrest under a single bill recognized this overlap, as each is “directly relevant to the broader question of how citizens can lawfully respond when faced with urgent and unlawful threats to their property, to themselves and to others” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 58, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., December 1, 2011, at p. 3833 (Robert Goguen)). Initial steps taken to defend one’s property may transition into a situation of self‑defence. Likewise, separate defences may rightly apply to distinct offences or phases of an incident (Cormier, at para. 67). At the same time, great care is needed to properly articulate the threat or use of force that existed at a particular point in time so that the assessment of the accused’s action can be properly aligned to their stated purpose. Clarity of purpose is not meant to categorize the accused’s conduct in discrete silos, but instead appreciate the full context of a confrontation, how it evolved and the accused’s role, if any, in bringing that evolution about. As recognized by the then-Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Justice at second reading, “all of these laws, any one of which may be pertinent to a given case, must be clear, flexible and provide the right balance between self-help and the resort to the police. That is why all these measures are joined together in Bill C-26” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 58, at p. 3833 (Robert Goguen)). (3)The Response— Paragraph 34(1)(c): Was the Accused’s Conduct Reasonable in the Circumstances? [62]The final inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) examines the accused’s response to the use or threat of force and requires that “the act committed [be] reasonable in the circumstances”. The reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) operates to ensure that the law of self‑defence conforms to community norms of conduct.  By grounding the law of self-defence in the conduct expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances, an appropriate balance is achieved between respecting the security of the person who acts and security of the person acted upon. The law of self-defence might otherwise “encourage hot‑headedness and unnecessary resorts to violent self‑help” (Roach, at pp. 277‑78). That the moral character of self-defence is thus now inextricably linked to the reasonableness of the accused’s act is especially important as certain conditions that were essential to self-defence under the old regime — such as the nature of the force or threat of force raising a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm — have been turned into mere factors under s. 34(2). [63]The transition to “reasonableness” under s. 34(1)(c) illustrates the new scheme’s orientation towards broad and flexible language. While later judicial interpretations of the old law treated the words “no more force than is necessary” as akin to “reasonableness” (R. v. Gunning, 2005 SCC 27, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627, at paras. 25 and 37;R. v. Szczerbaniwicz,2010 SCC 15, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 455, at paras. 20‑21), the new provision explicitly adopts this standard and applies it in all cases. As such, the ordinary meaning of the provision is more apparent to the everyday citizen and not dependent on an appreciation of judicial interpretation or terms of art (Technical Guide, at p. 21). This reflects Parliament’s intent to make the law of self-defence more comprehensible and accessible to the Canadian public (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 109, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., April 24, 2012, at pp. 7063-64 (Robert Goguen)). [64]Through s. 34(2), Parliament has also expressly structured how a decision maker ought to determine whether an act of self-defence was reasonable in the circumstances. As the language of the provision dictates, the starting point is that reasonableness will be measured according to “the relevant circumstances of the person, the other parties and the act”. This standard both casts a wide net of inquiry covering how the act happened and what role each person played and modifies the objective standard to take into account certain characteristics of the accused — including size, age, gender, and physical capabilities (s. 34(2)(e)). Also added into the equation are certain experiences of the accused, including the relationship and history of violence between the parties (s. 34(2)(f) and (f.1)). [65]Nevertheless, the trier of fact should not be invited to simply slip into the mind of the accused. The focus must remain on what a reasonable person would have done in comparable circumstances and not what a particular accused thought at the time. For example, even if Mr. Khill’s military training qualifies as a relevant personal characteristic, it does not convert the reasonableness determination into a personal standard built only for him, much less a lower standard than would otherwise be expected of a reasonable person in his shoes. The law of self-defence cannot offer different rules of engagement for what happens at the homes of those with military experience or allow “training” to replace discernment and judgment. Section 34(1)(c) asks whether the “act committed is reasonable in the circumstances”. It does not ask whether Mr. Khill’s military training makes his act reasonable nor whether it was reasonable for this accused to have committed the act. The question is: what would a reasonable person with similar military training do in those civilian circumstances? [66]As observed by Doherty J.A. at para. 58 of his reasons, the “relevant circumstances of the accused” in s. 34(2) can also include any mistaken beliefs reasonably held by the accused. If the court determines that the accused believed wrongly, but on reasonable grounds, that force was being used or threatened against them under s. 34(1)(a), that finding is relevant to the reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c). However, while s. 34(1)(a) and (b) address the belief and the subjective purpose of the accused, the reasonableness inquiry under s. 34(1)(c) is primarily concerned with the reasonableness of the accused’sactions, not their mental state.",

        "Facts": " (C. C. Ruby,Sentencing(2nd ed. 1980), at pp. 423-24) [171]Unlike starting points, ranges are not presumptions. Sentencing judges do not have to begin their analysis at the range and adjust the sentence to reflect the individualized circumstances of the accused. Ranges simply demonstrate the typical breadth of sentences for an offence. In considering the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender together, they allow judges to give full effect to both of these elements. [172]I find it telling that the Court of Appeal of Alberta considered that using starting points for young offenders was inappropriate because of the significant measure of individualization in sentencing a young person (R. v. W. (C.W.)(1986), 43 Alta. L.R. (2d) 208, at pp. 212-13). This Court has now clearly stated that “sentencing is first and foremost an individualized exercise” for adult offenders as well (Boudreault, at para. 58). If starting points are incompatible with individualization for young offenders, they should be for adult offenders as well. (ii)Pre‑Weighing Factors by the Appellate Court [173]By “building in” some factors to the starting point, the appellate court effectively prescribes the weight to be given to these factors by sentencing judges, displacing the sentencing judges’ discretion to determine their weight. A portion of the analysis is already conducted. Pre‑weighing factors directly encroaches on sentencing judges’ discretion: “The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about” (McKnight, at para. 35, cited with approval inNasogaluak, at para. 46). Even where it is not done explicitly, as my colleagues propose (at para. 46), mitigating factors will always be implicitly “built in” to starting points, as the very notion of a starting point requires a baseline or archetypal offence and offender. [174]Take “good character”, a factor built in starting points (Arcand, at para. 132;Felix(ABCA), at para. 45). Absent a finding that the offender’s character was “even better than might be supposed”, a sentencing judge may not give it different or additional weight (Arcand, at para. 135). Sentencing judges, not appellate courts, should determine what weight to give to this factor in light of the individual circumstances of the offender. Building this factor into the starting point interferes with sentencing judges’ ability and duty to consider all relevant circumstances in sentencing (Stone, at para. 244). Moreover, building in “good character” assumes that it applies in the same way to all offenders and overlooks that good character has many degrees (Bloos and Renke, at p. 803). Such a methodology is incompatible with individualized sentencing. [175]I acknowledge that some sentencing ranges have also incorporated mitigating factors such as prior good character into the sentencing range (see, e.g.,R. v. H. (C.N.)(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 564 (C.A.), at para. 32;R. v. Voong,2015 BCCA 285, 374 B.C.A.C. 166;R. v. Cunningham(1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (Ont. CA), at p. 546). They do not represent the norm. In my view, building in such factors in ranges is also questionable having regard to individualization. But, in any case, building in factors in a range does not impede individualization in the same way as starting points. Sentencing judges retain the discretion to evaluate the weight of the good character of the accused (for example) within or even outside the range. Judges using the starting-point approach do not. (iii)Starting Points Produce an Artificial Sentencing Methodology by Overemphasizing the Judicially Created Category [176]Under the starting‑point approach, categorization is pivotal. For example, while “not always easy to draw” (Felix(ABCA), at para. 51), the distinction between commercial and wholesale trafficking in cocaine is the difference between a three and four and one-half‑year starting point (R. v. Rahime, 2001 ABCA 203, 95 Alta. L.R. (3d) 237, at para. 18;R. v. Ma, 2003 ABCA 220, 23 Alta. L.R. (4th) 14). If the same proportion applies to fentanyl, this elusive distinction will determine whether a six or nine‑year starting point is applicable. This improperly shifts the main focus from whether a sentence is just and appropriate for an offender to which judicially‑created category applies. In addition, the starting-point approach requires parties and judges to identify which factors can justify deviation from the starting point having regard to the factors that are already built in the hypothetical baseline offence. As M. R. Bloos and M. C. Plaxton say, starting points “subject the sentencing process to an unnatural compartmentalization of factors that either over‑complicates the process, or forces the sentencing judge to give certain factors more or less weight than is appropriate” (“Starting-Point Sentencing and the Application ofLabergeIn Unlawful Act Manslaughter Cases” (2003), 6C.R.(6th) 346, at p. 352). [177]Sentencing judges should not be burdened with such artificial and convoluted debates, rules and categories. They should instead consider all relevant factors in an integrated manner and compare them to comparable cases to determine the just and appropriate sentence for the offender before the court (Bloos and Plaxton, at p. 352). [178]Sentencing ranges do not raise similar concerns. Ranges for related categories typically overlap, while the jump from one starting point to the next is jagged. Ranges instruct sentencing judges to view the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender as a matter of degree, on a continuum. As a result, as the intervener the Legal Aid Society of Alberta notes, ranges “rarely see judges bogged down in disagreements about whether an offence comes within a defined subcategory, or whether a fact aggravates or mitigates compared to some hypothetical baseline offence” (I.F., at para. 3). It is a methodology more conducive to individualized sentencing. (iv)The “Clustering” Effect of Starting Points [179]Commentators have noted that the starting-point approach has the “natural effect of bunching sentences around a median rather than spreading them across a range to suit individualized circumstances” (Manson (1997), at p. 282). This is the “clustering” effect, which is “antithetical to individualization: the more clustering we observe, the less likely it is that sentence outcomes reflect the unique nature of each case or are proportionate” (I. D. Marder and J. Pina‑Sánchez, “Nudge the judge? Theorizing the interaction between heuristics, sentencing guidelines and sentence clustering” (2020), 20C.C.J.399, at p. 401). By contrast, sentences spread along ranges can better reflect individualized circumstances. [180]The parties contest whether “clustering” can be empirically established. However, I note that “clustering” effects in sentencing have been studied by several commentators (see, e.g., Marder and Pina‑Sánchez; M. W. Bennett, “Confronting Cognitive ‘Anchoring Effect’ and ‘Blind Spot’ Biases in Federal Sentencing: A Modest Solution for Reforming a Fundamental Flaw” (2014), 104J. Crim. L. & Criminology489, at pp. 523‑29 (finding that even advisory sentencing grids acted as a “hulking anchor for most judges”); D. M. Isaacs, “Baseline Framing in Sentencing” (2011), 121Yale L.J.426, at p. 426 (finding that “sentences disproportionately cluste[r] around the typical sentence in a typical crime baseline regime” (emphasis deleted)); C. Guthrie, J. J. Rachlinski and A. J. Wistrich, “Inside the Judicial Mind” (2001), 86Cornell L. Rev.777, at pp. 787‑94 (on the “anchoring” effect of numerical values more generally)). The anchoring effect is a well‑known cognitive bias: final judgments are disproportionately biased toward the starting point of a decision‑maker’s reasoning (A. Tversky and D. Kahneman, “Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases” (1974), 185Science1124, at p. 1128). While sentencing ranges can also produce clustering effects, this tends to be in jurisdictions where ranges are established by sentencing grids (e.g., various U.S. states) or by sentencing commissions (e.g., the United Kingdom) (Marder and Pina‑Sánchez; Bennett). [181]The Crown points to sentences that deviate significantly from the starting point as evidence of the absence of clustering effect. In many of the cases it cites, however, the Court of Appeal intervened and varied restrained sentences that were crafted because of the individual circumstances of offenders and offences for not properly applying a starting point (R. v. Corbiere,2017 ABCA 164, 53 Alta. L.R. (6th) 1;R. v. Giroux,2018 ABCA 56, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 21;R. v. L’Hirondelle, 2018 ABCA 33;R. v. Melnyk, 2014 ABCA 344, 584 A.R. 238). Consequently, these cases do not stand for the proposition that the starting-point approach is compatible with individualized sentencing and do not refute the clustering effect. [182]In addition, “clustering” also follows logically. For instance, it will be more difficult to impose a 90‑day sentence for an offender convicted of trafficking in cocaine or crack cocaine with strong rehabilitative potential and significant mitigating factors if the starting point is 3 years than if there is a 6 months to 4 years range of sentence (comp.R. v. Godfrey, 2018 ABCA 369, 77 Alta. L.R. (6th) 213, andR. v. Zawahra, 2016 QCCA 871). [183]While there is a paucity of empirical evidence, what there is reinforces the views that starting points are problematic in practice, as well as in principle. (b)Starting Points Overemphasize Denunciation and Deterrence [184]In theory, the Court of Appeal could set starting points to account for the various principles of sentencing. But this would overlook how starting points operate in practice. Starting points are often established to emphasize deterrence and denunciation and, in turn, to ensure more retributive punishment (Manson (1997), at p. 279, citingR. v. Sprague(1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 513 (Alta. C.A.);Johnas). This runs contrary to the objectives of the 1996 sentencing reform: “. . . reducing the use of prison as a sanction [and] expanding the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing” (Gladue, at para. 48; s. 718.2(e) of theCriminal Code).

        "Facts": "[57]In this appeal the party admission was something the accused said, that the witness overheard, and that the Crown tendered as evidence of the accused’s guilt (Evans, at p. 664; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). However, party admissions can constitute more than words; the common law has held party admissions to include,inter alia, silence, actions, and demeanour(see, e.g.,R. v. Scott, 2013 MBCA 7, 288 Man. R. (2d) 188; see also Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶6.470-6.512; Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 911). As noted by Professor I. Younger, a rule of thumb is that “[a]nything the other side ever said or did will be admissible so long as it has something to do with the case” (An Irreverent Introduction to Hearsay(1977), at p. 24, cited in Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). I do not seek to describe here the precise boundaries of party admissions, as that is not at issue. [58]A trial judge’s determination that evidence is hearsay but falls within an exception from the general exclusionary rule is a question of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness. (c)Determine Whether to Use Judicial Discretion to Exclude the Evidence [59]Finally, judges must determine whether they should exercise their discretion to exclude evidence by balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. Judges sitting with juries should consider the extent to which any prejudicial effect can be attenuated by appropriate instructions to the jury as to the use to which the evidence can properly be put. In addition, evidence can be excluded where there was a significant unfairness associated with obtaining it, such that it would render the accused’s trial unfair (Mohan;Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 47-48; Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶2.75-2.77; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6). No such consideration arises in the circumstances of this case. [60]Probative value relates to the degree of relevance to trial issues and the strength of inference that can be drawn from evidence (R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at para. 26, citingR. v. Robertson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, at p. 943;Hart,at paras. 94-98). Prejudicial effect relates to the likelihood that a jury will misuse the evidence (Hart,at para. 106; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 52). Weighing probative value against prejudicial effect has been referred to as a “cost benefit analysis” (Mohan,at pp. 21-22;Hart,at para. 94; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6). [61]As noted, the “cost” associated with the evidence (i.e. the prejudice) can be attenuated by appropriate jury instructions.  Proper instructions can effectively equip juries with an understanding of how to use evidence in a judicial manner (R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, at para. 116;R. v. Griffin, 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at para. 69). [62]A trial judge’s determination that the probative value of evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect is discretionary and should be reviewed with deference (R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 31;R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 73). In addition, appellate courts are to review alleged errors in jury instructions “in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole” (R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32, as cited inAraya, at para. 39) so as to afford trial judges “some flexibility in crafting the language of jury instructions” (Araya,at para. 39). I would underscore the importance of trial judges providing clear analysis on the probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence to facilitate appellate review. (2)Application of the Legal Framework to the Circumstances of This Case (a)The Evidence Was Relevant [63]The brother’s testimony regarding the overheard conversation was relevant. First, there was sufficient context for the jury to give meaning to the words that the brother overheard, such that the evidence overcomes the low threshold for (logical) relevance. Second, it is not fatal that the brother was uncertain as to the exact words that he heard the accused say. The equivocal nature of the brother’s testimony is a factor for consideration when weighing the probative value against the prejudicial effect. It also relates to ultimate reliability and believability; but those are for the trier of fact in weighing the evidence, rather than the judge in the relevance analysis. [64]The trial judge needed to determine whether, on the basis of all the evidence, the jury could give meaning (in a way that was not speculative) to what the brother testified that he overheard. The context extended beyond the narrow scope that the majority of the Court of Appeal applied. Other evidence properly informed the brother’s testimony as to what he overheard.  In the days leading up to the phone call at issue, the accused and the brother had spoken about the victim. During these conversations, the accused admitted he had done “something bad”, told the brother that it was “true” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 107, 111 and 113), and the brother said that the accused was “remorsefully sad. Glad to get it off his chest, per se” (p. 121). On the day of the phone call: the accused told the brother where the victim’s body was; the brother was with the accused when he attempted suicide; and the brother was with the accused in the time leading up to the phone call to his wife. Finally, the brother testified that the accused referred to the victim at the opening of the call. The brother was present, although standing approximately 10 feet away, for the entire call. [65]I turn now toFerris, the decision of this Court that the trial judge and Court of Appeal below agreed governed the admissibility of the evidence. [66]Ferrisconcerned admissibility of hearsay evidence that the Crown sought to adduce as a party admission. Police arrested Mr. Ferris for murder and brought him to the station. Mr. Ferris asked to make a phone call. An officer placed the call, handed Mr. Ferris the phone, then walked towards his desk. As the officer walked away, he overheard Mr. Ferris say “I’ve been arrested” and then, sometime later, “I killed David” (Ferris(C.A.), at para. 7). The trial judge admitted the officer’s testimony as to what he heard Mr. Ferris say. Mr. Ferris was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. [67]The Alberta Court of Appeal overturned the trial decision, holding that a properly instructed jury would be unable to ascribemeaningto the words the officer overheard. Words that were incapable of meaning could not be probative of any issue, and, therefore, were not relevant. Evidence that was not relevant was not admissible. The issue was not what weight to ascribe to the officer’s testimony, but whether the words he overheard hadanymeaning. The Court observed that “hearsay rules do not do away with the requirement of relevancy” (para. 32). [68]The Court of Appeal explained that the phrase “I killed David” could have been an admission. It also could have been part of a reply to the question “what [do] the police think [you] did?” (para. 17). The words, “on their own”, did not “allow for the proper understanding and appreciation of the meaning of the statement” (para. 24). The officer’s testimony was inadmissible because the jury could not interpret the meaning of the words without “gross speculation” (para. 49). [69]This Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision inFerrisin the result. In a short, oral judgment, Sopinka J. stated that even if the evidence had relevance, its meaning was “so speculative and its probative value so tenuous that the trial judge ought to have excluded it on the ground its prejudicial effect overbore its probative value” (p. 756). On a careful reading, what Sopinka J. said wasnotthat the evidence was inadmissible based on relevance. This Court did not affirm the Court of Appeal’s relevance analysis or their application of the principled approach. Rather, Sopinka J. said that even if the testimony was relevant, it should have been excluded after balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. [70]The trial evidence inFerriswas dissimilar to the evidence in this case. InFerris, the accused and the police officer were strangers. There was nothing at all like the circumstances, sequence of events and conversations that led up to what in this case the brother overheard in the accused’s conversation with his wife. [71]Again, we must bear in mind the difference between relevance and ultimate reliability. How well the brother could recall the words said by the accused relates to the latter, which is a question for the trier of fact. Few people would remember the exact words used in a recent conversation that they listened to intently. Nonetheless, many of us would be able to recall the gist of that conversation. The rules of evidence must respond to this reality. Probative value analysis and the weight given to the evidence by the trier of fact are sufficient mechanisms to address frailties of memory. These frailties do notalsoneed to be addressed when determining relevance. [72]Ferrisis good law, but must be carefully read. Indeed, [translation] “[e]xclusion of a partial conversation is . . . not automatic and the analysis is above all a contextual one” (Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 970). I would note its application in three decisions:R. v. Bennight, 2012 BCCA 190, 320 B.C.A.C. 195,R. v. Buttazzoni, 2019 ONCA 645, andR. v. Hummel,2002 YKCA 6, 166 C.C.C. (3d) 30. See alsoR. v. Reierson, 2010 BCCA 381, 259 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at para. 40. [73]Bennightis factually somewhat similar to this case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed testimony from a corrections officer who could not recall the particular words that the offender said to her. The court held it was sufficient that “the witness could testify to both the ‘gist’ of the statement and the context in which it was made” (para. 92). That the officer was unable to remember the precise words said was not pertinent to the judge’s relevance analysis: incompleteness was a matter of weight for the jury. The accused argued before this Court thatBennightwas different because the corrections officer heard both sides of the conversation. I find this to be a distinction without a difference. What matters is whether the evidencetends to increase or decrease the probability of a fact, not the particular circumstances in which the evidence arose. [74]InButtazzoni,the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge properly admitted “recounted utterances [that] were described as ‘almost verbatim’”, andalsoproperly admitted recounted utterances that were a “paraphrased synopsis” (para. 56). Issues with accuracy of recollection did not relate to relevance, but were an issue of weight for the trier of fact. Similarly toBennight, the witness overheard both sides of the conversation. However, as noted, that is not a principled basis on which to distinguish these decisions from the circumstances in this appeal. [75]The accused inHummelargued on appeal that the trial judge improperly admitted testimony that suggested he said “I hear a woman’s voice calling my name” and “from a grave” (para. 8). The Yukon Court of Appeal held there was “ample context in which the words could be considered”, as the accused had uttered the words the morning after the victim was last seen alive and there was other evidence connecting him to the victim’s disappearance (para. 32). The jury could infer the accused was expressing remorse through these words. [76]These decisions illustrate thatFerrisshould not be understood as standing for the proposition that incomplete recollection of a party admission leads to exclusion of such evidence or that it is only “micro context” that can inform meaning and, thus, relevance. In assessing (logical) relevance, what matters is whether the evidence tends to increase or decrease the probability of the existence of a fact at issue (Arp, at para. 38). [77]Although he could not remember the exact words the accused said, the brother’s testimony was that he overheard a phone call in which the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. The brother’s recollection of the phone call, if believed by the jury, (to use the words fromArp) “tend[s] to ‘increase . . . the probability’” that the accused was responsible for the victim’s death. In light of other evidence, the brother’s evidence was capable of non-speculative meaning and relevant. (b)The Evidence Was Hearsay, but Subject to the Party Admissions Exception to the Exclusionary Rule [78]The Crown adduced the brother’s evidence for the purpose of showing that the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. This evidence was hearsay and, thus, inadmissible under the general exclusionary rule. However, the brother’s evidence was that the accused had, by his words, admitted responsibility for Ms. Kogawa’s death. This evidence is something that a party said or did and relates to an issue at trial (see Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92; Younger, at p. 24). As such, the evidence is a party admission and comes within a recognized exception to the general exclusionary rule. (c)In Light of the Comprehensive Jury Instructions, the Trial Judge Did Not Err by Admitting the Evidence [79]The balancing of probative weight against prejudicial effect can be critical in deciding the admissibility of a party admission. This is a discretionary decision by the trial judge. Such decisions are to be reviewed with deference. The accused has not shown error in this exercise of the trial judge’s discretion. This is particularly so in light of the well-structured instructions provided to the jury on appropriate use of the party admission. [80]The brother’s testimony contained weaknesses. He was unsure of the particular words that the accused said. He testified that he was not trying to listen and that he only heard one side of the conversation. He did not know whether the accused was responding to questions from his wife. The brother admitted he consumed alcohol before and after the call and that the accused was under the influence of intoxicants. The brother testified that the accused’s speech was impacted by the heroin he had taken. These factors decreased the probative value of the party admission. [81]With respect to the prejudicial effect, I agree with Arbour J., dissenting, but not on this point, that juries are likely to give significant weight to confession-like evidence (R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 146). This Court has recognized the significant potential for prejudicial use of confessions (see, e.g.,Hart, at para. 106) and this party admission was akin to a confession. The possibility for prejudicial use by the jury was real. [82]When balancing the probative value and prejudicial effect, the trial judge noted “[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence” (para. 21). The trial judge provided such a caution on the proper use of the admission at issue. This demonstrates the trial judge was mindful of potential prejudice. The trial judge told the jury that it was up to them to decide whether the statements attributed by the brother to the accused had been made. They were to “[c]onsider the circumstances in which the conversation took place [and to b]ear in mind anything else that may make the witness’s evidence more or less reliable” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 197). The trial judge methodically addressed the weaknesses in the brother’s testimony in the jury instructions. She emphasized that the brother heard only one side of the conversation and that he did not recall the exact words that the accused said. She noted that the accused had consumed alcohol and heroin prior to the call, and that those intoxicants could have affected what he said. The judge made clear that it was for the jury to determine whether the accused had used a particular phrase and what was meant by it. The judge told the jury they could ignore the admission if they were uncertain as to what was said or what it meant. She told the jury that they could not rely on the brother’s testimony as to the accused’s state of mind. Rather, it was for the jury to consider such matters. [83]The trial judge provided the jury with clear and effective instructions on proper use of the brother’s testimony. The instructions gave the jury the guidance needed to weigh the evidence in accordance with legal principles. As such, the instructions effectively and adequately limited the possibility of prejudicial use. [84]In light of the foregoing, the trial judge did not err in admitting the brother’s testimony as to what he overheard the accused say. B.Jury Question Issue [85]I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of the Court of Appeal on the Jury Question Issue. The jury’s question was not ambiguous and the trial judge answered it correctly. Notwithstanding my agreement, I wish to underscore two points. [86]First, the accused argues on appeal that the jury question demonstrated confusion as to the intent needed for murder and that needed for manslaughter. However, the accused’s counsel at trial (not appellate counsel) was adamant that this wasnotwhat the jury’s question related to. That trial counsel advocated for a certain response to a jury’s question is not determinative of the issue on appeal, but it is an important factor for consideration (R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 38;Araya, at para. 51). While the burden of perfection should not be placed on trial counsel, they are the ones most attuned to the accused’s interests. In this case, trial counsel pivoted away from intent and suggested that the trial judge provide to the jury an “expanded definition of bodily harm” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 330). This approach likely represented trial counsel’s view as to how to answer the question correctly, in a manner beneficial to his client. I see no error in the trial judge’s handling of the question, particularly in light of trial counsel’s submissions on this point. [87]Second, there is no merit to the accused’s argument that the definition of “bodily harm” ins. 2of theCriminal Codedoes not apply tos. 229(a)(ii), which defines murder. The meaning of the phrase “bodily harm” is consistent throughout theCriminal Code. When Parliament means to deviate from the meaning of “bodily harm”, it does so by adding qualifying words (e.g., “grievous bodily harm” ins. 25(3)). No authority from this Court, includingR. v. Miljevic, 2011 SCC 8, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 203, should be read as suggesting otherwise. The accused’s argument that murder requires bodily harm that is serious, dangerous or grave seems to stem from an inaccurate understanding of the model jury instructions. The words that he suggests describe bodily harm — dangerous, serious, grave — concern foreseeability. To reiterate, the definition of “bodily harm” set out ins. 2applies tos. 229(a)(ii). VI.Conclusion [88]I would allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the accused’s conviction for second degree murder.  The following are the reasons delivered by  Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. — [89]We would dismiss this appeal. We do not disagree with our colleagues’ framework for assessing relevance and probative value. What divides us is its application here. In our view, for the reasons of Justice Goepel at the Court of Appeal, a jury could not ascertain the meaning or relevance of the overheard statements (2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131). As well, their prejudicial effect outweighed any tenuous probative value they may have had. The overheard statements were inadmissible. [90]On the evidence before the jury, it was impossible to know what Schneider said to his wife during the overheard phone call. The witness, Schneider’s brother, did not know the words that he heard. He was deliberately tryingnotto listen to the 13‑minute conversation. He neither participated in the conversation nor heard both sides of it. He acknowledged that he did not know what was said, and did not even recall knowing the substance of what was said. Initially, he testified in examination‑in‑chief that he heard Schneider say, “I did it. I killed her” about half‑way into the phone call (A.R., vol. II, at p. 170). He then clarified that he could not say those were the exact words spoken but that this was “the gist” of Schneider’s side of the conversation (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171). It appears that this “gist” was derived from a statement he had heard six or seven minutes earlier in the conversation and, the Crown says, from the trauma of having accompanied his brother during a suicide attempt. In cross‑examination, the witness confirmed that because he did not know Schneider’s exact words, they may have just been something like “I did it” and that the words — whatever they were — could have come at the beginning, middle or end of a longer sentence (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 189‑90). [91]At trial, the Crown sought to tender the words overheard by Schneider’s brother as an admission of responsibility for the death of the victim, Natsumi Kogawa. In closing submissions, the Crown stated that Schneider was overheard telling his wife “I did it” or “I killed her” ⸺ though also acknowledging the exact words spoken were unknown ⸺ and told the jury that “you can infer from these words that he intended to kill Natsumi Kogawa or meant to kill Natsumi Kogawa” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 286). [92]Assessing the relevance of Schneider’s brother’s testimony (including the Crown’s own interpretive gloss thereon) is an exercise in pure speculation. The Crown’s reliance on “context” to assist in identifying the relevance of the witness’s “gist” of the conversation is not only a strain; it is also far more harmful than it is helpful. For the Crown, this “context” includes the fact that the brother knew Schneider, that they had talked about the victim in the days leading up to the phone call, that Schneider told his brother some details of his relationship with Ms. Kogawa and that her body could be found in a suitcase prior to the phone conversation, that the brother was physically present for the phone conversation and the attempted suicide, and that he had an understanding of the “tone” of the conversation. These factors add nothing to the assessment of what had been said during the phone call. [93]Our colleagues overstate the significance of the Court of Appeal’s references to the “macro” and “micro” contexts (Rowe J.’s reasons, at paras. 6, 28 and 42). These statements were not intended to alter assessments of relevance. Rather, they were simply shorthand for what the majority and the dissent considered to be the relevant context. Justice DeWitt‑Van Oosten took a broader view of the relevant context (which, in our respectful view, overreached by considering the same irrelevant factors as the Crown), while Justice Goepel (correctly) confined himself to considering the context arising from the conversation itself. This is not to say that context beyond the immediate conversation can never inform the meaning of statements made within the conversation. Rather, in this case, the Crown relies on contextual features beyond the conversation itself that were irrelevant, and there was insufficient context arising from the conversation itself to inform the meaning of the overheard statements. [94]In our view, the Crown relies on “context” that is not only irrelevant, but which augments the prejudicial effect of admitting the statements even if they were relevant. The jury may have focused on aspects of the context which tended to implicate Schneider in the death ⸺ such as his statement about where Ms. Kogawa’s body was located ⸺ to reason that Schneider must have therefore admitted responsibility for the death. InR. v. Ferris(1994), 149 A.R. 1 (C.A.), at para. 27, Conrad J.A. described the danger involved in this type of reasoning as follows: There would be an enormous temptation for any trier of fact to look at the outside evidence that tends to implicate the accused in the murder, use those facts to conclude that the accused probably committed the murder, and that therefore he admitted that he did. That finding would then be used to raise the probability of guilt to a conclusion of guilt. The danger implicit in that type of circuitous reasoning is obvious. This very concern arises in the instant case where the jury was left to assess the logical relevance of a “gist”, unaccompanied by any recollection of what was said, or at least any recollection of the substance of what was said. [95]The trial judge did not explicitly identify any dangers of admitting the evidence of the overheard statements or how they might impact the fairness of the trial. She simply concluded that “[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence” (2018 BCSC 2546, at para. 21, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 5). In our view, the jury instruction did not cure the prejudice. It presupposed that the jury could decide what Schneider said despite having no basis in the evidence to do so. [96]We conclude that the evidence of the overheard statements should not have been admitted. We acknowledge that the threshold for logical relevance is low. But it is stilla threshold, in that it must “increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” (R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38, citing R. Eggleston,Evidence, Proof and Probability(2nd ed. 1978), at p. 83). If Schneider’s brother’s testimony meets this threshold, it would be difficult to conceive of anything Schneider might have said (or might be felt to have said), howsoever partial, oblique or indistinct, that wouldnotbe “relevant”. In any event, when the potential for misuse is measured against the absence of any significant probative value, the result is that the evidence should have been removed from the jury’s consideration altogether. [97]We would therefore dismiss the appeal. ",

        "Facts": "(Friesen, at para. 93) [219]It must be remembered that even when child luring is committed in the context of a police operation, it must never be seen “as a victimless crime” (Friesen, at para. 94). [220]It is difficult to claim that the conduct of an offender arrested as a result of a sting operation poses no risk of harm. Parliament designed the offence of child luring precisely to prevent such a risk from materializing, that is, to apprehend “offenders before they can successfully target and harm children” (Friesen, at para. 94). In this sense, police operations are a key element in the arsenal available to law enforcement agencies to apprehend offenders before it is too late (para. 94). [221]In short, requiring a high level ofmens reaensures that the offence of child luring captures only conduct that involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness as well as serious harm or a risk of such harm (Friesen, at para. 76). (b)The Effects of the Minimum Term of Imprisonment on the Offenders in the Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenarios Are Not Incompatible With Human Dignity [222]In addition to the scope of the offence, the grossly disproportionate nature of a mandatory minimum sentence is assessed in light of the effects that the penalty may have on the reasonably foreseeable offender (Hills, at para. 133). If these effects entail so much pain and suffering that they undermine human dignity, the impugned provision cannot survive constitutional scrutiny (para. 133). That is not the case here. [223]For both of the hypothetical offenders, the effects identified by my colleague relate to the treatment they might receive in prison. It seems that imprisonment itself — and not its length — is what plays a major role in her analysis. Although my colleague refrains from concluding that the effects in question, which, I might add, are inherent to incarceration, are such as to undermine human dignity, she nevertheless finds that the first offender’s individual circumstances “would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave” (para. 151) and that, for the second offender, “[t]he six‑month mandatory minimum in this case is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence” (para. 152). Such reasoning has major implications; its logical consequence is that any minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed on an offender who has just reached adulthood or on a person with a mental illness will be grossly disproportionate, regardless of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances surrounding its commission. Such an outcome seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the deference owed to Parliament. Indeed, “if few mandatory minimums can survive the scrutiny exemplified in [my colleague’s] reasons on s. 12, then one must question what role is left for Parliament’s legitimate policy choices in setting punishment” (Lloyd, at para. 107, per Wagner J. (as he then was), Gascon and Brown JJ., dissenting). [224]In any event, as explained above, I conclude that a nine‑month term of imprisonment would be fit and appropriate for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario and that a six‑month term of imprisonment is a fit and appropriate punishment in the second hypothetical scenario. In the first case, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) results in an additional period of imprisonment of three months. In the second case, the application of s. 172.1(2)Cr. C.would therefore result in an additional six months’ imprisonment if the offence were prosecuted by indictment. [225]I cannot bring myself to conclude that any additional period of imprisonment has effects that are incompatible with human dignity, because this would amount to indirectly introducing a standard of proportionality. I wish to make one important clarification. My remarks should not be taken to mean that, once incarceration is found to be the fit and appropriate punishment, any additional period of imprisonment is immune from constitutional scrutiny because the offender in question already has to deal with the negative effects associated with imprisonment. In this case, however, there is nothing in the record that allows me to identify “the precise harm associated” with this additional period of imprisonment (Hills, at para. 133). Nevertheless, since the period is relatively short, I am of the view that its effects are not incompatible with human dignity. (c)The Minimum Term of Imprisonment Is Not Grossly Disproportionate to What Is Necessary To Achieve Parliament’s Objectives [226]The final stage of the analysis is meant to determine whether the minimum sentence “goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament’s sentencing objectives relevant to the offence” (Hills, at para. 138). In this inquiry, courts must consider “the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives” (Hills, at para. 138, quotingR. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at pp. 1099‑1100). However, it is essential to bear in mind at this stage that gross disproportionality is the constitutional standard that applies in the analysis unders. 12of theCharter. I reiterate this because, in my opinion, my colleague’s reasoning transforms the standard of gross disproportionality into one of proportionality. [227]This shift in her analysis can first be seen at para. 158, where she argues that, for offenders whose mental illness contributed to the commission of an offence, “specific deterrence, general deterrence and denunciation are of little use”. With respect, this argument misses the mark.",

        "Facts": "[140]The judge then read the two subsections of s. 21, which relate to party liability and common intention. He did not give any explanation as to which subsection might apply, how they might be applicable, or the possible status of the accused as a party to the robbery (see pp. 323‑24). In this case, there is no suggestion that the judge failed to explainhowthe definition of a criminal organization related to the offence of participation in the activities of such an organization. [141]In cases of alleged non‑direction, as was discussed at the hearing, the question may come down to the degree of “obviousness” of the point of law at issue. While I accept that certain legal requirements are not “obvious” or plain from the statutory text — for example,mens rearequirements for various offences — the point of law at issue in the instant case was obvious or plain to the jury, in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole. [142]With respect, my colleague’s discussion of stereotypical or improper reasoning (at paras. 84‑86 and 92) is also misplaced. First, the issue in this case is not whether structure and continuity serve as safeguards against stereotypical or improper reasoning. It is whether the jury understood structure and continuity to be legal requirements of the offence, based on what the judge did tell the jury. [143]Second, this issue was not discussed in the court below, including by Paciocco J.A. in dissent. The appellant himself states that it “may have been possible for the jury to infer a continuous group based on a shared neighbourhood, loyalty to one’s friends, and the commission of similar crimes — or perhaps even in combination with the shared cultural indicia — but the trial judge was required to adequately equip them to assess this evidence”, which in turn required an instruction on the elements of structure and continuity (A.F., at para. 35). This reinforces that the issue in this case is simply whether the jury understood the legal elements of the definition of a criminal organization, absent the judge’s use of the precise words “structure” and “continuity”. [144]Third, Detective Kerr’s evidence was not contested by the defence at trial (see A.R., vol. I, at p. 59; A.R., vol. XXXII, at pp. 15 and 20). The trial judge related his evidence to photographs of the appellant showing certain indicia of gang membership, as well as to certain behaviours consistent with street gangs (see A.R., vol. I, at pp. 99, 113, 151, 211 and 214). I agree that evidence of a common social or cultural identity does not identify the existence of a criminal organization. But there is a significant difference between this, in a generic sense, and indicia of the appellant’s gang membership more specifically, such as displays of the Bloods’ hand sign. While the nature of a jury trial necessarily means that the jury’s reasons for a guilty verdict are unclear, Detective Kerr’s evidence was only part of the evidence put forward by the Crown to prove the existence of a criminal organization. The Crown also relied, crucially, on intercepted wiretap conversations in which the appellant discussed plans to transport firearms on an ongoing basis. [145]Finally, I reiterate and emphasize that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — and not necessarily perfectly — instructed (Goforth, at para. 20;Daley, at para. 31;Jacquard, at paras. 2 and 32). InJacquard, Lamer C.J. held that appellate courts must “ensure that the yardstick by which we measure the fitness of a trial judge’s directions to the jury does not become overly onerous” (para. 1). He elaborated as follows: We must strive to avoid the proliferation of very lengthy charges in which judges often quote large extracts from appellate decisions simply to safeguard verdicts from appeal. Neither the Crown nor the accused benefits from a confused jury. Indeed justice suffers. ",

In both cases, the Court of Appeal erred in using the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions and reviewing the alleged improper generalizations on a correctness standard. As a result, the court failed to adopt the required contextual and functional review, leading it to overturn the trial judges’ decisions without a proper basis to do so. [101]With respect, the Court of Appeal’s approach in both cases reflects the fundamental problems with the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions. The rule invited the court to parse the trial judges’ reasons in search of any assumptions drawn in their credibility and reliability assessments. This had the unfortunate effect ofmisidentifying particular phrases the trial judges used as “assumptions”, divorcing those findings from their context and the reasons as a whole. In going even further and elevating the alleged assumptions intoerrors of law, the court applied the wrong standard of review. As a result, in both cases, many of the assumptions identified by the court were either not assumptions at all or were otherwise ordinary factual findings reviewable for palpable and overriding error.

        "Facts": "[80]When the trial judge writes “[t]he past discreditable evidence”, he refers to the evidence establishing that the complainant had “found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with [the accused]” and that she was subjected to “threats, intimidation, and injury”. [81]The trial judge also concluded that such evidence does not “directly address” (paras. 42 and 57) or “directly support” (para. 31) the charges, and that evidence about the relationship between the accused and the complainant “offered little concerning the charges” (para. 41). I disagree. [82]In the following subsection, I will explain why the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused’s violence towards the complainant, while certainly discreditable to the accused, was covered by the indictment and could not, in this case, be characterized as evidence of past discreditable conduct. (c)Regular Violence and Threats of Violence by the Accused Were Covered by the Indictment [83]The Crown filed a two-count indictment. Since the two counts are linked, and the trial judge acquitted the accused on the second count based on the same reasons he acquitted the accused on the first count, my reasons will focus exclusively on the trafficking in persons count: [T]hat he between the 1stday of November, 2006 and the 31stday of December, 2011, at and near Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton, Alberta, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, did unlawfully recruit, exercise control or direction or influence over the movements of [the complainant], for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation, contrary to Section 279.01(1) of theCriminal Code.  (A.R., vol. I, at p. 5) [84]The time period spans over five years between November 1, 2006, when the accused and the complainant first moved to Fort Saskatchewan (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 197-98 and 202), and December 31, 2011, not long before they separated. During that time period, the accused and the complainant moved from Fort Saskatchewan to Edmonton and then back to Halifax, all of which are covered by the indictment (trial reasons, at paras. 4, 7 and 10). [85]The trial judge could not ignore that the regular violence and threats of violence as provided in the evidence by the other witnesses took place within the specified time period, at the specified locations, and was directed towards the complainant. [86]The trial judge did not conclude that the accused’s regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant fell outside the factual parameters of the indictment. Rather, he held, as a matter of law, that the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was not an element of theactus reusof the trafficking in persons offence, nor the definition of exploitation. This is why it “fell to” the complainant to provide that evidence. [87]This interpretation finds support in para. 45 of the trial judge’s reasons: Given that the . . . prior witnesses could not provide direct evidence of the elements of these offences, it fell to [the complainant] to provide that testimony. Consequently, her credibility comes into play. [88]Read in isolation, this sentence reveals an error of law. Evidence can be direct or circumstantial, and both types of evidence can satisfy a judge beyond reasonable doubt that a fact in issue is true (D. Watt,Watt’s Manual of Criminal Evidence(2024), at §§ 1:17-1:18). Read contextually, this sentence reflects the trial judge’s concern that the evidence of the other witnesses on the accused’s violence did not “directly address” (paras. 42 and 57), or “directly support” (para. 31) the charges. [89]At trial, although the accused never argued that the other witnesses’ evidence was past discreditable conduct evidence, he argued that very little evidence related to the actual substance of the allegation, and referred to evidence of the accused’s violence as evidence of surrounding circumstances evidence that only “takes you so far” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 405). Later in oral submissions, defence counsel argued that the complainant was “the only one who can speak to several of the essential elements in terms of the control and the alleged forcing into the sex trade”, and who can tell the trial judge that the accused exploited her (p. 431; see also pp. 406 and 432). [90]The trial judge’s conclusion thus rejects the Crown’s theory of the case, which sought to establish that the accused had controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant “through the overwhelming evidence that [the complainant] was in a relationship that was physically and psychologically abusive and controlling” (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 393-94). (d)Regular Violence and Threats of Violence by an Accused Can Be Relevant and Material to the Actus Reus [91]Regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim and, more generally, their violent relationship, can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements during a period of time, provided that the effect of that violence is that the victim’s movements have been effectively controlled, directed, or influenced during that time. Violence is also relevant and material to the definition of exploitation, as this definition is met when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service, and could be reasonably expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service.",
